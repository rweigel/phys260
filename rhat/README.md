# Motivation and Observations

The motivation for this activity is textbooks and instructors use $\rhat$ for some Coulomb law and electric field problems but not for others with no explanation. Or, equations with $\rhat$ are given, but $\rhat$ is not used explicitly in examples.

For example, Young and Freedman ([Chapter 21 of  2015, 14th Edition](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SkPFIdgiiEv_5sV_QIijzxKOLIPPAwd_/view?usp=drive_link★★★★remove★★★★)) and Halliday and Resnick do not use $\rhat$ for Coulomb's law problems. Both give the equation for electric field in terms of $\rhat$. Young and Friedman use $\rhat$ their electric field examples but only provide the definition $\rhat=\rhat/r$ (with no reference to Section 1.9 where they review unit vectors). Halliday and Resnick do not use $\rhat$ their examples.

We have found that without a separate activity, students are not able to explain the meaning of $\rhat$, and when they read solutions that use it, they don't understand that the $\rhat$ method is simply an alternative method for computing $\bfvec{E}$.

Observations

* In principle, all electric force and field problems in this course can be solved with or without using $\rhat$. Students tend not to use the $\rhat$ method unless they have done an activity that introduces it.

* Most solutions to electric force and field problems the students will find do not use $\rhat$. As a result, some instructors avoid its use entirely.

* In  [Chapter 21.3 of Young and Freedman 2015, 14th Edition](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SkPFIdgiiEv_5sV_QIijzxKOLIPPAwd_/view?usp=drive_link★★★★remove★★★★), $\rhat$ is not used for electric force, but is used for electric field.

%Here we assume students are familiar with computing $\bfvec{E}$ without using $\rhat$.

# Absolute Value and Magnitude Subtilty

For students who have an easy time with the problems, ask how

$$|\bfvec{E}|=E=\sqrt{E_x^2+E_y^2}$$

with 

$\ds E_x=k\frac{q_1}{8a^2}\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$ and $\ds E_y=k\frac{q_1}{8a^2}\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$ 

results in an aboslute value in $E=k|q_1|/{8a^2}$.

Or, ask them to show that

$\ds \left|kq_1\frac{\rhat}{r^2}\right|\quad$ is $\quad \ds k|q_1|\frac{1}{r^2}$,

where in the first equation $|\cdot|$ means vector magnitude and in second equation it means absolute value. (Use $\rhat=r_x\ihat + r_y\jhat$, $\sqrt{r_x^2+r_y^2} = 1$, and $\sqrt{q_1^2}=|q_1|$.)
