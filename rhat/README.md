# Motivation and Observations

The motivation for this activity is textbooks and instructors use $\rhat$ for some problems but not for others with no explanation. 

We have found that without a separate activity, students are not able to explain the meaning of $\rhat$ and when they read solutions that use it, they don't understand that the $\rhat$ method is simply an alternative method for computing $\bfvec{E}$.

Observations

* In principle, all electric force and field problems in this course can be solved with or without using $\rhat$. Students tend to not use the $\rhat$ method unless they have done an activity that introduces it.

* Most solutions to electric force and field problems the students will find do not use $\rhat$. As a result, some instructors avoid its use entirely.

* In  [Chapter 21.3 of Young and Freedman 2015, 14th Edition](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SkPFIdgiiEv_5sV_QIijzxKOLIPPAwd_/view?usp=drive_link★★★★remove★★★★), $\rhat$ is not used for electric force, but is used for electric field.

%Here we assume students are familiar with computing $\bfvec{E}$ without using $\rhat$.

# Last Question on Activity

A first guess is the equation

$$\bfvec{F}=kq_1q_2\frac{\rhat}{r^2}$$

which is incomplete. The complete equation is

$$\bfvec{F}_{q_1 \text{ on } q_2}=kq_1q_2\frac{\rhat_{12}}{r^2}$$

where $\rhat_{12}$ is a unit vector that points from $q_1$ towards $q_2$. This subtiltly is perhaps why intro textbooks only use $\rhat$ notation for electric field problems.
