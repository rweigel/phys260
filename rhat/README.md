# General Comments

Th motivation for this activity is textbooks and instructors often use $\rhat$ for some problems and not for other problems, with no explanation. Here we assume students are familiar with computing $\bfvec{E}$ without using $\rhat$.

In principle, all problems at this level can be solved without using $\rhat$. However, it often appears in lecture slides and textbooks and we've found that without a separate activity, students are not able to explain the meaning of $\rhat$ and when they read solutions that use it, they don't understand that the $\rhat$ method is simply an alternative method for computing  $\bfvec{E}$.

# Last Question on Activity

A first guess is the equation

$$\bfvec{F}=kq_1q_2\frac{\rhat}{r^2}\thinspace,$$

which is incomplete. The complete equation is

$$\bfvec{F}_{q_1 \text{ on } q_2}=kq_1q_2\frac{\rhat_{12}}{r^2}\thinspace,$$

where $\rhat_{12}$ is a unit vector that points from $q_1$ towards $q_2$. This subtiltly is perhaps why intro textbooks only use $\rhat$ notation for electric field problems.
