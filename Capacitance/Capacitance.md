# Overview

The general technique for computing capacitance when Gauss's law applies is:

1. Place an equal and opposite amount of charge on the conductors.
2. Use Gauss's law to compute the electric field between the conductors.
3. Use $V(b)-V(a)=-\int^b_a \mathbf{E}\bfcdot d\mathbf{l}$ to find the potential difference between the conductors.
4. Use the equation for capacitance to find $C$: $C = Q/|\Delta V| = Q/|V(b)-V(a)|$.

# Parallel Plate

An equal and opposite amount of charge is placed on two conducting and parallel plates as shown on the left in the following figure. On the right, a side view of the plates is shown. The area of the plates, $A = w^2$, is much larger than shown such that the width, $w$, is much larger than the separation distance, $d$.

1. How will the charges distribute on each of the plates? That is, how much charge is on each of the four faces that have area $A$? Assume that no charge appears on the other (narrow, and having thickness $t$) faces of the plates, which have a much smaller area. 

2. What is the electric field in each of the five regions? (Hint: Use the equation for the field outside of a large and uniformly charged sheet and account for the field due to the charges on the surface of each plate, which was derived using Gauss’s law.) 

3. How much work would it take to move a charge qo from the left plate to the right plate (i.e., the distance d shown)? Said another way, what is the difference in electric potential energy, $U_r-U_l$, between the right and left plate?
 
4. How much work does it take to move a charge qo from the outer face of a plate to the inner face of the same plate? (Hint: What is the electric field inside of the plates?) 

5. What is the electric potential difference, $V_r – V_l$ , between the left and right plate?
 
6. What is the electric potential difference between the inner and outer faces of one of the plates?

7. Write the capacitance in terms of $k$, $A$, and $d$.

8. Explain why the thickness of the plates does not appear in the equation for capacitance.

# Spherical

Charge is uniformly distributed on two spherical conducting shells, the cross--section of which is shown. Both shells have a thickness of $t$. The inner shell has an outer radius of $a$ and a net charge of $-Q$. The outer shell has an inner radius of $b$ and a net charge of $+Q$. Assume that $Q$ is positive.

1. Use Gauss's law to show that there can be no charge on the inner surface of the inner conductor. 

2. Use Gauss's law again to show that the charge on the inner surface of the outer conductor is $+Q$. 

3. Show that there is no charge on the outer surface of the outer conductor.
 
4. What is the electric field in each of the 5 labeled regions? Region 1. is the empty volume inside of the inner conductor, region 2. is the volume of the inner conductor, region 3. is the empty volume between the conductors, region 4. is the volume of the outer conductor, and region 5. is the region outside of the outer conductor. (Hint: Use Gauss's law several times.)
 
5. How much work will it take to move a charge qo from the outer surface of the inner shell to the inner surface of the outer shell? Said another way, what is the difference in electric potential, Ub -Ua?
 
6. What is the potential difference, $V(b) - V(a)$?

7. Write the capacitance in terms of $k$, $A$, and $d$.
