# Cylindrical

Charge placed on two long cylindrical conducting shells, the cross--section of which is shown. Both shells have a thickness of $t$. The inner shell has an outer radius of $a$ and a net charge of $-Q$. The outer shell has an inner radius of $b$ and a net charge of $+Q$. Assume that $Q$ is positive and the cylinders have length $L$.

1. How will the charges distribute on each surface (assume no charge appears on the ends of the cylinders)? That is, what is the total charge on

   * the inner surface of the inner cylinder,
   * the outer surface of the inner cylinder,
   * the inner surface of the outer cylinder, and
   * the outer surface of the outer cylinder.

7. How much work would the electric field do on a charge $q_o$ moved from $r=a$ to $r=b$? What would be the change in $q_o$'s electric potential energy?
