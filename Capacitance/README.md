The first part of these two problems were solved for in the lectures on Gauss's law. The latter parts were solved in the lecture on capacitance. They also appear in the textbook.

Most did not start on the second problem, and roughly 1/2 of the students were able to get the correct answer for the capacitance for the first problem.

I gave a 5-minute overview of capacitance and how it is calculated and then let them start on the first problem. After about 5 minutes, I wrote the diagram on the board and explained that the charges would move to the inner faces. Then I explained in words that they could find the field due to each face using $\sigma/(2\epsilon_o)$ and superposition and drew colored vectors for the field due to each face in all 5 regions. Even then, only about 1/2 of the students were able to determine the total electric field in each region.

Once students had the field between the faces, many struggled to apply the general formula for potential difference. For some students, I suggested that we know E is constant and so the result will be |E|d, and you can reason out what the sign will be. It is clear to me that there needs to be a separate activity on dot products and line integrals.

At least three students did not know how to evaluate $\int_0^d (\sigma/\epsilon_o) dx$ even after I said it was equivalent to $\int_0^d (\text{const}) dx$.

Based on the results this week, this activity should be revised so that students can make more progress.

I've attached an activity on capacitance. My notes from last time make it clear that this activity is far too ambitious. If I have time on the weekend, I'll break up the first problem into two parts. Even then, I'm concerned that they have not done the activity where they integrate both a constant electric field and a 1/r^2 field, and so they'll have even more trouble with the V(b)-V(a) formula. I may change it so the formulas for V(b)-V(a) are given in the introduction for those two fields. Based on what I say below, few understand the dot product integral.

I was surprised how much difficulty students had with the capacitance tutorial, as I'm sure this was covered in lecture. Those who got to the spherical capacitor had no idea how to use a Gaussian surface to "prove" the things asked for. If they did answer, most of them didn't even try to draw the Gaussian surface, and those who did mostly messed it up or had unclear drawings. I would suggest we provide a drawing for them to work with, and that it have thicker conductors, to make it easier to show the Gaussian surface inside the conductor. 

Many of them didn't even get to that part. 

A minor point: question 4 of section 2 should ask for the answer in terms of epsilon_0, not k. 

I think we need to expand section 3 to give them more guidance. Just asking for a proof leaves them stumped. 

This might mean skipping section 2, because I don't think they have time to do both.
