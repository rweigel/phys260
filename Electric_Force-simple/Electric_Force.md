**Electric Force**

*Magnitude*: $\displaystyle F=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_o}\frac{|q_1q_2|}{r^2}$

*Direction*: Force is along line that connects $q_1$ and $q_2$. Direction depends on signs of $q_1$ and $q_2$. (Likes repel, opposites attract.) $r$ is separation distance. Sometimes $k$ is used in place of the proportionality constanat $1/4\pi\epsilon_o$.

**Electric Field**

Compute force $\mathbf{F}$ due to all other charges on a hypothetical charge $q$ at point where you want to compute $\mathbf{E}$. To find $\mathbf{E}$ at that point, divide $\mathbf{F}$ by $q$.

$$\mathbf{E} = \frac{\mathbf{F}}{q}$$

To find $\mathbf{F}$ when a different charge $Q$ is placed where $q$ was, multiply $\mathbf{E}$ by $Q$.

# Electric Force

Charge $q_1$ is at $(x, y) = (a, a)$. Charge $q_2$ is at $(x, y) = (a, 2a)$. Draw this charge configuration on the provided graph paper.

1. Find the magnitude of the force that $q_1$ exerts on $q_2$. Show your work in the space below. Compare your answer with other students in your group.

2. Find the direction of the force that $q_1$ exerts on $q_2$ assuming both $q_1$ and $q_2$ are positive. Express your answer as an angle with respect to the $x$-axis, with counterclockwise rotation being positive. Show your work in the space below.

<div style="height:10em"/>

Draw the two charges described above three times in the space below and label them 3., 4., and 5. Draw arrows to indicate the directions of movement.

3. If $q_1$ and $q_2$ are both positive, in what directions will each move if released?

4. If $q_1$ and $q_2$ are both negative, in what directions will each move if released?

5. If $q_1$ and $q_2$ have opposite signs, in what directions will each move if released?

# Electric Field

Charge $q_1$ is at $(x, y) = (a, a)$.

1. Find the magnitude of the electric field at $(x, y) = (a, 2a)$. Show your work. Compare your answer with other students in your group.

<div style="height:4em"/>

2. Find the direction of the electric field at $(x, y) = (a, 2a)$ if $q_1$ is positive. Express your answer as an angle with respect to the $x$-axis, with counterclockwise rotation being positive. Show your work.

<div style="height:4em"/>

3. If there are no other charges besides $q_1$, why it does not make sense to ask what the electric force is at $(x, y) = (a, 2a)$?

<div style="height:4em"/>

4. If a charge $Q$ is placed at $(a, 2a)$, what will be the magnitude of the electric force that is exerted on it? Will the direction of this force depend on the signs of $q_1$ and $Q$?

# $\mathbf{E}$ for a System of Charges

Charge $q_1 = +q$ is at $(x, y) = (a, 0)$, charge $q_2 = +q$ is at $(x, y) = (-a, 0)$, and charge $q_3 = -q$ is at $(x, y) = (0, a)$. Assume that the quantity associated with $q$ is positive. Draw this charge configuration on the provided graph paper.

1. Find the electric field magnitude and direction at the origin. Show your work in the space below.

<div style="height:8em"/>

2. Find the electric field magnitude and direction at the origin if $q_1=-q$.
