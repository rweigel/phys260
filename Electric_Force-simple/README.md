In my review prior to students working, I emphasize the use of vector notation and quickly do a version of the first problem on the board. I find that approximately 3/4 of the students write equations with scalar = vector or vice--versa. When helping students, I comment on this error before answering any questions.

I have used two different versions of the first problem. In version 1., the charges at $(x, y) = (a, a)$ and $(x, y) = (a, 2a)$ so they are aligned vertically. In version 2., the second charge is at $(2a, 2a)$ so they are aligned at a $45^\circ$ angle.

For version 1., I mention that the first problem is easily solved without vectors but is good for practice becuase one can quickly compare an answer found using vector notation with the answer found without.

The second problem is essentially a repetition of the first and its answers are the answers to the previous divided by $q_2$ (about 1/2 of the students notice this). This problem is used to reinforce the idea that we attribute an electric field to an empty point in space and the electric field is a quantity that tells us what would happen if we put a charge at that empty point in space. In my introductory remarks, I mention that the gravitational field $\mathbf{g}$ is a vector field and we determine it by putting a mass at a previously empty point in space and then measuring its acceleration when released.

In a 50--minute recitation with a 10--minute review, few students get beyond the first few questions of part 2.
