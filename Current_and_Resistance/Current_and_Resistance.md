A $9$ Volt battery is connected to a wire of length $10$ meters with circular cross section and a radius of $0.01$ meters. The wire has a resistivity of $10^{-8}\Omega\cdot\text{m}$. The density of charge carriers is $10^{28}/\text{m}^3$.

1.  What is the resistance (with units) of the wire?

2.  How much charge flows past a cross section of the wire per second?

3.  What is the current (with units) in the wire?

4.  What is the current density (with units) that flows through the wire?

5.  What is the drift velocity of electrons in the wire? (The charge on an electron is $-1.6Â·10^{-19}\text{ C}$.)

A battery is connected to a wire of length $20$ meters with circular cross section and a radius of $0.01$ meters. The wire has a resistivity of $10^{-7}\Omega\cdot\text{m}$. The density of charge carriers is $10^{27}/\text{m}^3$. The current in the wire was measured and found to be $1$ Ampere.
