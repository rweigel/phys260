# Introduction

## Definitions

Current is defined as the rate of change of charge, $Q$, per time. If you were able to count the number of charges passing a cross--section of a wire over $1\text{ s}$, the current would be $Q/t$. If the amount of time was small, say $\Delta t$, and your labeled your count as $\Delta Q$, then $I = {\Delta Q}/{\Delta t}$. In the limit that $\Delta t$ approaches zero, we have the definition 

$$I = \frac{dQ}{dt}$$

If $n$ is the number of charges with charge $q$ per volume and $v_d$ is the average velocity of the charges (called the "drift velocity"), then

$$I = nqv_dA$$

where $A$ is the cross--sectional area of the wire.

We also define a quantity called the current density, $J$, which is the current per unit cross--sectional area, $A$:

$$J = \frac{I}{A}$$

## Ohm's Law

If an electric field exists in a wire (by, for example, connected its ends to a battery), the charges will accelerate until they collide with another particle and decelerate (resist the flow). The net result will be a flow of charges with a drift velocity. Experimentally, it has been shown that in many materials, the ratio of the electric field to current density is 

$$\rho = \frac{E}{J}$$

where the value of the constant $\rho$ depends on the material.

Ohm's law is

$$I = V/R$$

which means a voltage $V$ applied to a wire will result in a current $I$, and this current depends on $R$.

The resistance is larger the longer wire and smaller for a larger cross--section of wire. The result is

$$R = \frac{\rho L}{A}$$
