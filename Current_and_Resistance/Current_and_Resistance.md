# Introduction

## Definitions

The electric current in a wire is defined as 

$$I = \frac{dQ}{dt}$$

where $dQ$ is the total amount of charge that passes through a cross--section of the wire in a differential amount of time, $dt$.

If $q$ is the charge (in Coulombs) of each flowing charge, $n$ is their number per volume, $v_d$ their average speed along the wire (called the "drift velocity"), then

$$I = n|q|v_dA$$

where $A$ is the cross--sectional area of the wire.

We also define the current density, $J = n|q|v_d$, which is the current per cross--sectional area:

$$J=\frac{I}{A}$$

## Ohm's Law

If an electric field exists in a wire (by, for example, connecting its ends to a battery), the charges will accelerate until they collide with another particle and decelerate (collisions resist the flow). The net result will be a flow of charges with a drift velocity. Experimentally, it has been shown that in many materials, the ratio of the electric field to current density is 

$$\rho = \frac{E}{J}$$

where the value of the constant $\rho$ depends on the material.

Ohm's law is

$$I = V/R$$

which means a voltage $V$ applied to a wire will result in a current $I$, and this current depends on $R$.

For a wire of length $L$ with a constant cross--sectional area $A$, resistance is proportional to $L$ and inversely proportional $A$:

$$R = \frac{\rho L}{A}$$
