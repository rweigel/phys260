Project https://ophysics.com/em8.html on screen before class starts.

Go over example in part 2. on board. The problems seem easy and so going over it may seem uneccssary. But experience says otherwise.

Part 3. Usually requires 5-minutes of explanation on the board. After the first student has finished Part 2., stop class and explain part 3. Otherwise, many students get stuck on the problems.

Remind students that figure is repeated on following page. Many students put all answers on page with first figure.

In Part 2., the absolute value and magnitude operators are used in the third step of $|\bfvec{F}| = |-qv_oB_o\jhat| = |-qv_oB_o||\jhat| = |q|v_oB_o$. Few students notice this and I typically ask about the distinction after the've used it implicitly in a few of their solutions.

The activity does not disucss what happens when $q\rightarrow -q$ changes sign or $\bfvec{v}\rightarrow -\bfvec{v}$. I typically wait for students to realize that this seems important and ask.

Remind students of the convention for "into the page" and "out of page" vector directions.

Discuss the fact that the figure in 2.2 does not indicate the direction of $z$ and that the right--hand rule dictates that it must be out of the page (and it is was not, the coordinate system would not be "right--handed" and the right--hand rules would not give correct answers).


Remind students not to equate a scalar to a vector.
