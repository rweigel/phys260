# Coulomb's Law

*Magnitude*

$$F_{1\mbox{ on } 2}=F_{2\mbox{ on } 1}=k\frac{|q_1q_2|}{r^2}$$

where $r$ is the distance between $q_1$ and $q_2$. To simplify notation, we are using $k$ in place of $1/4\pi\epsilon_o$. Note that by definition, the magnitude of a vector is positive, which is the reason for the use of the absolute value.

*Direction*

Along line that connects $q_1$ and $q_2$. Direction depends on signs of $q_1$ and $q_2$. (Likes repel, opposites attract.).

# Example

Charge $q_1$ is at $(x,y)=(-a,-a)$ and charge $q_2$ is at $(a, a)$. Both charges have a charge of $q$.

1. Find the magnitude and direction of the force of $q_1$ on $q_2$.
2. Write the force of $q_1$ on $q_2$ in the form $\bfvec{F}=F_x\ihat + F_y\jhat$.
3. If the charges have opposite signs, how will your answers to 1. and 2. change?

**Solution**

1. The distance between the charges is $r=\sqrt{(2a)^2+(2a)^2}=2\sqrt{2}a$, so

   $$F_{1\mbox{ on } 2}=k\frac{|q_1q_2|}{r^2}=\frac{k|qq|}{(2\sqrt{2}a)^2}=\frac{kq^2}{8a^2}$$

   The charges will repel each other, so the direction of forces of one on the other will be as shown in the diagram. The direction of the force vector on $q_2$ is shown in the following diagram.

2. Let $F = F_{1\mbox{ on } 2}$ from part 1. to simplify notation. The diagram on the right shows the calculation of the components $F_x$ and $F_y$, from which it follows that $\bfvec{F} = F\cos 45^\circ \ihat + F\sin 45^\circ \jhat$.

3. The magnitude will not change (it is by definition a positive number). The force vectors will reverse direction as shown on the left in the following diagram. The diagram on the right shows the calculation of $\bfvec{F}_{1\mbox{ on } 2}$, from which it follows that $\bfvec{F}_{1\mbox{ on } 2} = -F\cos 45^\circ \ihat - F\sin 45^\circ \jhat$.
