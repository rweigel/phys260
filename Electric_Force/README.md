# General Comments

* Emphasize $|\bfvec{F}|$ and $F$ mean the same thing and they are always positive scalars.
* Emphasize the importance of the absolute value in the equation for $F$; ask how $F$ changes when charges have the same sign or opposite sign.
* At this point in the semester, many students will have difficulty with determining $r$ and it will help if Example 1 is worked through on the board.

# Example 1

Two approaches are given for computing components; most of the students use the "acute angle+diagram" approach, but some use the other approach. You may need to emphasize that they should choose the method they are most comfortable with.

# Problem 1

One could use the solutions to Example 1 to solve this quickly. Most students don't. Although very similar to Example 1, I find students still struggle even after going through the example. In some cases, I interrupt their work and go through the solution; otherwise some students won't finish this problem in a 50-minute recitation period.

# Problem 3

Students don't often recognize that a short-cut for finding $\sin\theta$ and $\cos\theta$ is to read it off from the diagram (instead of computing $\theta$ from an inverse tangent and plugging into $\cos$ and $\sin$). This short-cut is mentioned in the solution and, and I tell the advanced students the short--cut.
