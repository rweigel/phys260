# Computing $\Phi_B$ (Ch 29)

## Example

A spatially uniform external magnetic field points in the $\yhat$ direction and it is not changing with time. Assume that the normal direction of the cross-sectional area of loop is as shown in the diagram. \footnote{Recall that one can define to vectors that are perpendicular to a plane. Here we choose the normal as shown and as a result, positive rotation around the loop is determined by the right-hand rule using your thumb in the direction of the chosen normal direction.

The conducting loop of area $A$ is rotated in the direction shown.

1.  At what angles is the magnetic flux maximum, minimum, and zero?

2.  When $\phi=45^\circ$, is the magnetic flux positive or negative?

3.  When $\phi=135^\circ$, is the magnetic flux positive or negative?

4.  Based on your answers to (a)-(c), plot the magnetic flux as a function of $\phi$ as a smooth curve for $\phi=0$ to $\phi=180^\circ$.

{\bf Answer}:

\input{EMF and Induced Fields/figures/Square_Loop_III_Answer}

1.  At $\phi=0$, the flux will be a maximum, $\Phi_o=B_oA$. At $\phi=180^\circ$, the flux will be a minimum that is equal and magnitude and opposite in sign from the maximum. At $\phi=90^\circ$, the flux will be zero. 

2.  As shown in the diagram, the dot product of the normal vector and $\mathbf{B}_{ext}$ will be positive when $\phi=45^\circ$, so the flux will be positive.

3.  As shown in the diagram above, when $\phi=135^\circ$ the dot product of the normal vector and $\mathbf{B}_{ext}$ will be negative, so the flux will be negative.


4.  The curve is shown below. The curve is $\Phi=\Phi_o\cos\phi$.

## Problem

A spatially uniform external magnetic field points in the $\xhat$ direction and it is not changing with time.

The conducting loop is rotated in the direction shown at a constant rate.

Assume that the normal direction of the cross-sectional area of loop is as shown in the diagram.

1.  At what angles is the magnetic flux maximum, minimum, and zero? 

    {\bf Answer}:

    The magnetic flux will be zero when its surface is parallel to the external field (so that its normal/area vector is perpendicular to the external field). This corresponds to $\phi = 0^\circ$ and $\phi = 180^\circ$

    The maximum will be when all of the external magnetic field lines are parallel to the as the normal/area vector of the loop. This corresponds to $\phi = 270^\circ$.

    The minimum will be when all of the external magnetic field lines are anti-parallel to the as the normal/area vector of the loop. This corresponds to $\phi = 90^\circ$.

2.  When $\phi=45^\circ$, is the magnetic flux positive or negative? 

    {\bf Answer}: $\phi = 45^\circ$ is between one of the zeros and the minimum so it will be negative. 

3.  When $\phi=135^\circ$, is the magnetic flux positive or negative? 

    {\bf Answer}: $\phi = 135^\circ$ is between the minimum  and one of the zeros so it will be negative. 

4.  Based on your answers to (a)-(c), plot the magnetic flux as a function of $\phi$ as a smooth curve for $\phi=0$ to $\phi=180^\circ$.

5.  At what angle or angles will the induced current be zero? (Hint: Lenz's law states that the induced current occurs when there is a changing flux and {it change} means with respect to time.)

    {\bf Answer}: The change in time occurs when the slope of this curve is zero so it occurs at $\phi = 90^\circ$ and $\phi = 270^\circ$

6.  At what angle or angles will the magnitude of induced current be maximum?

    {\bf Answer}: The maximum current occurs at $\phi = 0^\circ$ and $\phi = 180^\circ$
