# General

The introduction of this activity does not describe how to determine the voltage changes across batteries and resistors. It is expected that the instructor will review this.

rsw: Mention at start that they should not solve using equivalent resistances unless instructed to do so. The reason is that they will see the motivation for equivalent resistances after doing a few problems without them. In addition, it may be better to learn KVL and KCL first and then learn about equivalent resistances separately.

# 2023 Spring

With a 20-minute introduction, most student got to part 4. In the future, split off the equivalent resistance part into a separate activity (and add background). The equiv. resistance problems were added here without explanation for students who found the other parts easy (usually 1-2 per class of 25).
