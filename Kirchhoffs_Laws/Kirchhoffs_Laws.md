# Kirchhoff’s Circuit Laws (Ch 27)
 
To find the current through each resistor in a circuit with batteries and resistors, Kirchhoff’s Current Law and Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law can be used. 

1.  Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law (KVL): The algebraic sum of all voltage drops around a closed loop must equal zero.
2.  Kirchhoff’s Current Law (KCL): The algebraic sum of all currents entering and exiting a node must equal zero.
 
## Single Loop Circuit

In a single loop circuit, only KVL is needed to find the current.

Assume the direction of current $I$ in the above circuit is counterclockwise. Write the equation for KVL and then solve for $$.

Assume the direction of current $I$ in the following circuit is clockwise. Write the equation for KVL and then solve for $I$.

Which value for $I$ found above is correct?

## Multiple Loop Circuit

Assume the direction of currents $I_1$, $I_2$, and $I_3$ in the following circuit are as shown.

1.  Write the equation for KVL for loop A.

2.  Write the equation for KVL for loop B. 

3.  Write the equation for KCL for node X.

Use the three equations found above to solve for the three unknowns, $I_1$, $I_2$, and $I_3$.

## Redundant KVL Equations

###

In the circuit for part II., there are three possible loops. The third loop is loop C. indicated below. 

1.  Write the equation for KVL for loop C. 

2.  Use the equation for KVL for loop B. and the KCL equation for node X from Part II with the KVL equation for loop C to find $I_1$, $I_2$, and $I_3$.

###

When solving circuit problems with multiple loops, you will generally find that you can use KVL and KCL to write more equations than there are unknowns. If you encounter a situation where you wrote $N$ equations based on KVL and KCL but cannot find $N$ unknows, the reason is that two or more of the $N$ equations that you wrote were not independent. To demonstrate this, for the circuit below,

1.  Write the KCL equation for node X

2.  Write the KCL equation for node Y

3.  Write the KVL equation for loop A
 
4.  Attempt to use the above three equations to solve for $I_1$, $I_2$, and $I_3$.
