# Enclosed Charge (Ch 22)

When using Gauss’s law, one needs to draw an imaginary volume in space and compute how much charge is inside the volume. Consider a solid and uniformly charged sphere of radius $b$ that is centered on the origin and has a volume charge density of $\rho_o$ (with units of charge per volume).

1. How much charge is enclosed in an imaginary sphere centered on the origin and having radius $r < b$? Write your answer in terms of one or more of $r$, $b$, and constants.

2. For an imaginary sphere of radius $r > b$,

    a. If the radius of this imaginary sphere doubles, do you expect the amount of charge to increase, decrease, or remain the same? Explain your answer.

    b. Find the amount of charge enclosed in this imaginary sphere in terms of one or more of $r$, $b$, and constants.

In the following diagram, a square sheet with a uniform surface charge density of $\sigma_o$ (with units of charge per area) is shown. An imaginary cylinder with height $h$ and radius $r$ is also shown.

3. If the height of the cylinder doubles, will the amount of charge it encloses increase, decrease, or stay the same? Explain.

4. In terms of one or more of $\sigma_o$, $r$, $h$, and constants, how much charge is enclosed in the imaginary cylinder?

5. In the diagram to the right, the cross section of two spherical shells, A and B is shown. The shells are centered on the origin and there is a point charge at the origin. The electric field lines due to the point charge are shown as lines with arrows. Which of the following is correct? Circle your answer.
 
    a. Electric flux through A > Electric flux through B

    b. Electric flux through A = Electric flux through B 

    c. Electric flux through A < Electric flux through B
