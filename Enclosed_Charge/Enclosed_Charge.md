title: Enclosed Charge
```

# Overview

When using Gaussâ€™s law, one must draw an imaginary volume in space and compute how much charge is inside the volume. Note that "charge enclosed" and "charge inside" are used interchangeably. 

In general, an imaginary volume is chosen is one for which computation of the electric flux is easy. That is, the imaginary volume will be such that the electric field is either parallel or perpendicular to all parts of the surface. In this activity, you are given the Gaussian volume. However, you should understand the reason for the choice of each Gaussian volume given.

# Densities

There are three types of charge densities, linear ($\lambda$), surface ($\sigma$), and volume ($\rho$).

Given a $Q$, and assuming $Q$ is uniformly distributed on (or within for a volume) an object, to find 

* $\lambda$, divide $Q$ by the length over which the charge is spread;
* $\sigma$, divide $Q$ by the area over which the charge is spread; and
* $\rho$, divide $Q$ by the volume over which the charge is spread.

To find $Q$ given a charge density, multiply the charge density by the relevant length, area, or volume.

Key formulas:

* $4\pi R^2$ -- surface area of sphere of radius $R$
* $2\pi R h$ -- surface area of curved part of cylinder of radius $R$ and height $h$
* $\pi R^2$ -- surface area of cap of cylinder of radius $R$
* $\pi R^2$ -- volume of cylinder cylinder of radius $R$ and height $h$: $\pi R^2 h
* $4\pi R^3/3$ -- volume of sphere of radius $R$

# Line of Charge

A total of $+3Q$ is uniformly distributed a non--conducting line of length $L$. The Gaussian cylinder shown has a length $h$, radius $r$, and the same center line as the charged line.

1. Find the linear charge density, $\lambda$, on the line.

   <div class="solutionstrue"> 
   {\bf Answer}: The linear charge density is the total charge divided by the length over which the charge is distributed: $\lambda={3Q}/{L}$.
   </div>

   <div class="solutionsfalse"> 
    <div style="height:3em"/>
   </div>

2. Find an equation for $Q_{\text{encl}}$ in terms of $\lambda$ and one or more of $r$, $h$, and $L$.

   <div class="solutionstrue">
   {\bf Answer}: The dashed line in the figure is the part of the line inside of the Gaussian cylinder. The length of the dashed line is $h$, so $Q_{\text{encl}}=\lambda h$. Another way of arriving at this is by noting that the charge enclosed is the total charge $\times$ the ratio $h/L$, so $Q_{\text{encl}}=3Q(h/L) = \lambda h$.

   </div>

3. Use your equation from 2. to find the amount of charge enclosed by the Gaussian cylinder when it has radii of $r=h/100$, $r=h/2$, $r=h$, and $r=2h$.

   <div class="solutionstrue">
   {\bf Answer}: $Q_{\text{encl}}=\lambda h$ for all four cases.

# Cylindrical Shell

A non--conducting hollow cylinder of radius $R$ and length $H$ has a charge of $+3Q$ uniformly distributed _on its curved surface_. The Gaussian cylinder shown has a length $h$, radius $r$, and the same center line as the charged cylinder.

<img src="figures/Hollow_Cylinder.svg"/>

1. Find the linear charge density, $\lambda$, of the charged cylinder.

   <div class="solutionstrue"> 
   {\bf Answer}: The linear charge density is the total charge divided by the length over which the charge is distributed: $\lambda={3Q}/{H}$.

   {\bf Note}: The charges are distributed on a surface, so it may seem more natural to use a surface charge density, which is $\sigma = 3Q/(2\pi R H)$, where the denominator is the surface area of the curved part of the charged cylinder. In this case, the answer to 2. does not change and the answer to 3. is $Q_{\text{encl}} = \sigma 2\pi R h$ instead of $Q_{\text{encl}}=\lambda h$. We use charge per length in this problem because the formula for $Q_{\text{encl}}$ is simpler.

   </div>

2. Find an equation for $Q_{\text{encl}}$ for $r<R$.

   <div class="solutionstrue"> 
   {\bf Answer}: If the Gaussian cylinder is fully inside the hollow cylinder, there would be no charge inside of it. As a result, the charge enclosed for $r< R$ is zero: $Q_{\text{encl}}=0$.
   </div>

   <div class="solutionsfalse"> 
      <div style="height:3em"/>
   </div>

3. Find an equation for $Q_{\text{encl}}$ for $r>R$. Your equation should involve $\lambda$ and one or more of $h$, $r$, and $R$.

   <div class="solutionstrue"> 
   {\bf Answer}: The amount of charge enclosed is the charge per unit length $\times h = \lambda h$, so  $Q_{\text{encl}}=\lambda h$. (The amount of charge enclosed does not depend on $r$.)

2. Find an equation for $Q_{\text{encl}}$ for $r\le R$. Your equation should involve $\rho$ and one or more of $h$, $r$, and $R$.

   <div class="solutionstrue">
