title: Enclosed Charge
```

# Overview

When using Gaussâ€™s law, one needs to draw an imaginary volume in space and compute how much charge is inside the volume.

In general, the imaginary volume that is used is one for which computation of the electric flux is easy. That is, the imaginary volume will be such that the electric field is either parallel or perpendicular to all parts of the surface.

In this activity, you are given the imaginary surface. To use Gauss's law, one must identify the imaginary surface that will allow for an easy calculation of the electric flux; this is not covered in this activity.

# Line of Charge

A total of $+3Q$ is uniformly distributed a non--conducting line of length $L$. The blue Gaussian cylinder shown has a length $h$, radius $r$, and the same center line as the charged line.

1. Find the linear charge density, $\lambda$, on the line.

    {\bf Answer}: The linear charge density is the total charge divided by the length over which the charge is distributed: $\lambda={3Q}/{L}$.


2. Find an equation for $Q_{\text{encl}}$ in terms of $\lambda$ and one or more of $r$, $h$, and $L$.

    {\bf Answer}: The dashed line in the figure is the part of the line inside of the Gaussian cylinder. The length of the dashed line is $h$. The charge enclosed for all four cases is $Q_{\text{encl}}=\lambda h$. In retrospect, one could have obtained the latter equation without considering the charge density -- the charge enclosed is the total charge $\times$ the ratio $h/L$.


3. Use your equation from 2. to find the amount of charge enclosed by the Gaussian cylinder when it has radii of $r=h/100$, $r=h/2$, $r=h$, and $r=2h$.

    {\bf Answer}: $Q_{\text{encl}}=\lambda h$ for all four cases.

4. Plot the four values of enclosed charge calculated above versus the radius of the Gaussian cylinder.

# Cylindrical Shell

A non--conducting hollow cylinder of radius $R$ and length $H$ has a charge of $+3Q$ distributed _on its curved surface_. The blue Gaussian cylinder shown has a length $h$ and radius $r$ and has the same center line as the charged cylinder.

<img src="figures/Hollow_Cylinder.svg"/>

1.  Find the linear charge density, $\lambda$, of the charged cylinder.

    {\bf Answer}: The linear charge density is the total charge divided by the length over which the charge is distributed: $\lambda={3Q}/{H}$.

    {\bf Note}: The charges are distributed on a surface, so it may see more natural to use a surface charge density, which is $\sigma = 3Q/\pi R^2$. In this case, the answer to 2. does not change and the answer to 3. is $Q_{\text{encl}} = \sigma 2\pi R h$ instead of $Q_{\text{encl}}=\lambda h$. The reason that we use charge per length in this problem is that the formula for $Q_{\text{encl}}$ is simpler.

2. Find an equation for $Q_{\text{encl}}$ for $r<R$.

    {\bf Answer}: Imagine that the blue Gaussian cylinder was fully inside of the hollow cylinder. There would be no charge inside of it. As a result, the charge enclosed for $r< R$ is zero, so $Q_{\text{encl}}=0$.

3. Find an equation for $Q_{\text{encl}}$ for $r>R$. Your equation should involve $\lambda$ and one or more of $h$, $r$, and $R$.

     {\bf Answer}: The amount of charge enclosed is the charge per unit length $\times h = \lambda h$, so  $Q_{\text{encl}}=\lambda h$. (The amount of charge enclosed does not depend on $r$.)

4. Find the amount of charge enclosed by the Gaussian cylinder when it has radii of $r=0$, $r=R/2$, $r=2R$, and $r=3R$.

    {\bf Answer}: $0, 0, \lambda h, \lambda h$

5. Plot the four values of enclosed charge calculated above versus the radius of the Gaussian cylinder. Then plot the equations found in parts 2. and 3 as a smooth line.

# Solid Cylinder

A non--conducting solid cylinder of radius, $R$ and length, $L$ has a charge of $+3Q$ uniformly distributed within it. The Gaussian cylinder has length $h$, radius $r$, and the same center line as the charged cylinder.

<img src="figures/Solid_Cylinder.svg"/>

1. Find the volume charge density, $\rho$, of the charged cylinder.

    {\bf Answer:} The volume, $V$, of the charged cylinder is its cross-sectional area, $\pi R^2$ times its height, $H$: $V=\pi R^2 H$. The charge density is charge/volume: $\rho=3Q/(\pi R^2 H)$.

2. Find an equation that relates $Q_{\text{encl}}$ and $r$ for $r\le R$. Your equation should involve $\rho$ and one or more of $h$, $r$, and $R$.

    {\bf Answer}: When $r<R$, the Gaussian cylinder is fully inside of the charged cylinder. The charge in the Gaussian cylinder is the charge density of the charged cylinder times the volume of _the Gaussian cylinder_: $Q_{\text{encl}}(r)=\rho \pi r^2 h$.

3. Find an equation that relates $Q_{\text{encl}}$ and $r$ for $r\ge R$. Your equation should involve $\rho$ and one or more of $h$, $r$, and $R$.

    {\bf Answer}: For any $r\ge R$, the amount of charge inside the Gaussian cylinder does not change with $r$: $Q_{\text{encl}}=\rho \pi R^2 h$, which is independent of $r$. 

2. Find the amount of charge enclosed in a Gaussian cylinder of radius $r=0$, $r=R/2$, $r=2R$, and $r=4R$.

    {\bf Answer}:  $0, \rho\pi R^2 h/4, \rho \pi R^2 h, \rho \pi R^2 h$

3. Plot the four values of enclosed charge  calculated above versus the radius of the Gaussian cylinder. Then plot the equations found in parts 2. and 3 as a smooth line.

    {\bf Answer}: $\ds \rho=3Q/[(4/3)\pi R^3]$

2. Find an equation that relates $Q_{\text{encl}}$ and $r$ for $r<R$. Your answer should involve $\rho$ and one or more of $r$ and $R$.

3. Find an equation that relates $Q_{\text{encl}}$ and $r$ for $r>R$. Your answer should involve $\rho$ and one or more of $r$ and $R$.

# Large Sheet

<img src="figures/Sheet.svg"/>

1. Find the surface charge density, $\sigma$, on the sheet.

    {\bf Answer}: $\sigma=3Q/L^2$

4. Find an equation for $Q_{\text{encl}}$ for $r<L$. Your answer should involve $\sigma$ and one or more of $r$, $h$, and $L$. (In Gauss's law problems, $L$ is much larger than $r$, so we do not need to consider cases of $r > L$.)

    {\bf Answer}: $Q_{\text{encl}}=\sigma \pi r^2$.

2. Find the amount of charge enclosed in Gaussian cylinder of radii $r=L/32$, $r=L/16$, $r=L/8$, $r=L/4$.
