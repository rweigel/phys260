In the directory Enclosed_Charge at https://www.overleaf.com/read/btssfxsjgyzr, there is an activity that I plan on using Monday (pdfs attached). If you want to make edits, the .tex version has a switch at the top to hide the solutions.

I used to cover the enclosed charge briefly when I covered Gauss's law until I realized that many students weren't able to compute the enclosed charge part (unless they remembered the answer). Instructors, including myself, and textbooks tend to spend the most time on the flux part of Gauss's law. This activity covers many parts that students need practice on (both at the freshman and junior level, I've found):

1. Plotting piecewise functions (the motivation for them plotting points is because many get stuck and I tell them to plot a few points first to give themself a hint)
2. Manipulating variables instead of numbers
3. Identifying how Q enclosed scales with the radius of the Gaussian volume (or other dimensions) and using this to check their plot and answers
4. Computing charge densities
5. Recalling formulas for volumes and areas (many don't know or recall that if they know the circumference of a circle, they can figure out the surface area of a cylinder and if they know the area of the circle, they can figure out its volume)

For the few students who have an easy time with these problems, I ask them to

1. draw the field lines for the charged object,
2. identify the conditions on the Gaussian volume such that the computation of flux through its surface is easy, and
3. compute the flux

I plan on spending 10 minutes doing one of the problems with the addition of doing 1.-3. above so they know the motivation for computing Q enclosed.

I always emphasize to students that final results should be in terms of the "given" variables of the problem when it is an algebraic problem. So, I would like to see questions 4. and 5. of each section ask explicitly for answers in terms of Q, not lambda or rho or sigma. I see the reason for doing it in terms of density in the earlier parts, but I think at some point they need to plug in the "givens": R, H, etc.

> Previously, I had them plotting Q_enclosed in terms of the variables given, but switched to using densities to lead them to the form of Q_enclosed that is used to compute the usual textbook formulas, which are typically given in terms of densities ... except for the case you mention below and outside a solid sphere.

In a similar vein, I don't see the need to ask for charge in terms of sigma in part 3 of section 5. I would rather have them realize that Q_encl is simply the total charge of the sphere when you are outside the sphere. I think telliing them they need to do an extra step might be more confusing than helpful. Maybe in this question we could just leave off the part that tells them what the answer should be in terms of, and then instructors could ask if they understand how to get it "the other way"?
