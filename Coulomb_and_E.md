# Electric Force

Charge $q_1$ is at $(x, y) = (a, a)$. Charge $q_2$ is at $(x, y) = (a, 2a)$. Draw this charge configuration on the provided graph paper.

1. Find the magnitude of the force that $q_1$ exerts on $q_2$. Show your work in the space below. Compare your result with the members of your group and make sure that you agree.

Draw the two charges described above three times in the space below and label them 3., 4., and 5. Draw arrows to indicate the directions of movement.

3. If $q_1$ and $q_2$ are both positive, in what directions will each move if released?

4. If $q_1$ and $q_2$ are both negative, in what directions will each move if released?

5. If $q_1$ and $q_2$ have opposite signs, in what directions will each move if released?

# Electric Field

Charge $q_1$ is at $(x, y) = (a, a)$.

1. Find the magnitude of the electric field at $(x, y) = (a, 2a)$. Show your work. Compare what you got with the other students in the group.
2. Find the direction of the electric field at $(x, y) = (a, 2a)$ if $q_1$ is positive. Express your answer as an angle with respect to the x-axis, with counterclockwise rotation being positive. Show your work.
3. Write an equation for the electric field at $(x, y) = (a, 2a)$ in vector notation (e.g., $\mathbf{E} = E_x\ihat + E_y\jhat$). Is your answer what you would have expected based on your answer to part 2.? Explain.  
4. If a charge $q_2$ is placed at $(a, 2a)$, what will be the electric force that is exerted on it? Express your answer in vector notation ($\mathbf{F}=F_x\ihat+F_y\jhat$). 
5. If charges $q_1$ and $q_2$ are positive, in what directions will the charges move?   Explain using your answer to part 4.
6. Charge $q_1 = q$ is at $(x, y) = (a, 0)$, charge $q_2 = -q$ is at $(x, y) = (-a, 0)$, and charge $q_3 = -q$ is at $(x, y) = (0, a)$. Assume $q$ is positive. Draw this charge configuration on the provided graph paper.
7. Find the electric field vector at the origin in the form $\mathbf{E} = E_x\ihat + E_y\jhat$. Show your work in the space below. Discuss the symmetry in the problem and how it impacts your answer. 
8. Explain the difference between electric field and electric force. Why it does not make sense to ask what the electric force is at the origin.
9. If a positive charge $q_o$ is placed at the origin, what will be the force (in vector notation) exerted on it? Which direction will the charge $q_o$ move if released?

# $\mathbf{E}$ for a System of Charges

Charge $q_1 = +q$ is at $(x, y) = (a, 0)$, charge $q_2 = +q$ is at $(x, y) = (-a, 0)$, and charge $q_3 = -q$ is at $(x, y) = (0, a)$. Draw this charge configuration on the provided graph paper.

1. Find the electric field vector at the origin in the form $\mathbf{E}=E_x\ihat + E_y\jhat$. Show your work in the space below. Discuss the symmetry in the problem and how it impacts your answer. 
2. Explain the difference between electric field and electric force. Why it does not make sense to ask what the electric force is at the origin.
3. If a charge qo is placed at the origin, what will be the force (in vector notation) exerted on it? Which direction will the charge qo move if released?
4. What is still confusing about electric forces and fields? If nothing, what is one thing that you learned from this tutorial?
