Title: Equivalent Resistance
```

# Introduction

The current in all parts of a circuit with resistors and batteries can always be found by writing equations for KVL and KCL and solving for the unknown currents. This was the approach taken in the Kirchhoff's law activity.

There is an alternative approach that is often faster:

1. replace resistors that are in series or parallel with equivalent resistances to create a new circuit. If no resistors are in series or parallel skip to step 3.
2. repeat step 1.
3. Use KCL and KVL to find currents in the remaining equivalent circuit.

In many problems, we are only interested in the currents through the batteries, in which case no further analysis is needed beyond step 3. If the currents in the resistors of the original circuit are needed, re-build it step--by--step finding all currents at each step using KCL and KVL.
