# General Comments

The problems in this activity can be solved by dividing the solution to a problem in the Electric Force activity by a charge. The motivation for this activity and such problems is that at this point, students still have difficulty with basic vector problems.

I emphasize that we've used fields before; $\mathbf{g}=-g\jhat$ is the gravitational field near Earth's surface. A field is a vector we assign to an empty point. We use the field to determine the force on an object when a mass is placed there. For charges, we place a charge at the empty point in space and use the electric field to find the force on the charge.

I ask why we use a "infinitesimal test charge" in the definition of $\bfvec{E}$. (If the charge is infinitesimal, it won't cause the charges that create the field to move; if the field--creating charges move, the field will change. Ask for analogies where we use a lightweight instrument to measure something so the instrument does not affect what we measure.)

# Common errors

1. Wrong signs on components
2. Wrong angle on problem I and II
3. In problem III, not recognizing vectors should be drawn at origin and not on individual changes.

Revision suggestions from Spring, 2023

1. Remove the "derivation" in example I. It is overly complicated.
2. Also note the equation for $\bfvec{F}$ using $\rhat$.

# Notes from Spring, 2023

1. ~50% of students only finished problem I. Many did it using the $\rhat$ method b/c that is what I did on the board last.
2. ~20% of students got to problem III. Only 1/25 finished.
