Self-reminders (rsw)

1. Emphasize that we've used fields before; $\mathbf{g}=-g\jhat$ is the gravitational field near Earth's surface. A field is a vector we assign to an empty point. We use the field to determine the force on an object when a mass is placed there. For charges, we pace a charge at the empty point in space and use the electric field to find the force on the charge.
1. Reminder that unit vector has unit length (meaning a length of 1) and is dimensionless.

Common errors:

1. Wrong signs on components
2. Wrong angle on problem I and II
3. In problem III, not recognizing vectors should be drawn at origin and not on individual changes.

Revision suggestions from Spring, 2023

1. Remove the "derivation" in example I. It is overly complicated.
2. Also note the equation for $\bfvec{F}$ using $\rhat$.

Notes from Spring, 2023

1. ~50% of students only finished problem I. Many did it using the $\rhat$ method b/c that is what I did on the board last.
2. ~20% of students got to problem III. Only 1/25 finished.
