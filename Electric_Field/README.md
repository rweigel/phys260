# General Comments

The problems in this activity can be solved by dividing the solution to a problem in the Electric Force activity by a charge. The motivations for having them solve the problem by first computing a force are (1) they need additional practice with the vector calculations for electric force and (2) to emphasize the definition of electric field.

I emphasize that we've used fields before; $\mathbf{g}=-g\jhat$ is the gravitational field near Earth's surface. A field is a vector we assign to an empty point. We use the field to determine the force on an object when a mass is placed there. For charges, we place a charge at the empty point in space and use the electric field to find the force on the charge.

Conceptual questions:

* Why do we sometimes see "infinitesimal test charge" in the definition of $\bfvec{E}$. (If the charge is infinitesimal, it won't cause the charges that create the field to move; if the field--creating charges move, the field will change. Ask for analogies where we use a lightweight and small instrument to measure something so the instrument does not affect what we measure.)
* Once the electric field is computed, do you know what it will be at another point?
* Are there any other points in space that will have the same electric field magnitude?
* Does it make sense to say "the electric force at an empty point in space is X?"
* Can you think of another quantity that we use in physics, that when multiplied by a property of an object, gives a force? (Answer: Pressure x cross section gives a force.)

# Common errors

1. Wrong signs on components
2. Wrong angle for problem I and II
3. In problem III, not recognizing vectors should be drawn at origin and not on individual changes.

# Notes from Spring, 2023

1. ~50% of students only finished problem I. Many did it using the $\rhat$ method b/c that is what I did on the board last.
2. ~20% of students got to problem III. Only 1/25 finished.
