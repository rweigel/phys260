1. Emphasise that we've used fields before; $\mathbf{g}=-g\jhat$ is the gravitational field near Earth's surface. A field is a vector we assign to an empty point. We use the field to determine the force on an object when a mass is placed there. For charges, we pace a charge at the empty point in space and use the electric field to find the force on the charge.
1. Reminder that unit vector has unit length (meaning a length of 1) and is dimensionless.
