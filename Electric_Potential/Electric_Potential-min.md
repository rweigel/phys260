1.  You place a charge of $+3\text{ C}$ at point $A$. What happens to that charge when it is released?

2.  You move charge of $+3\text{ C}$ from $a$ to $b$. (a) How much work did you do? (b) How much work was done by the electric field? (c) By how much has the potential energy of the charge changed?

3.  You place a charge of $-3\text{ C}$ at point $a$. What happens to that charge when it is released?

4.  A charge of $-3\text{ C}$ is moved from $a$ to $b$. How much work did you do? (b) How much work was done by the electric field? (c) By how much has the potential energy of the charge changed?

5.  You move a charge of $+3\text{ C}$ straight downward from $a$ to $c$. (a) How much work did you do? (b) How much work was done by the electric field? (c) By how much has the potential energy of the charge changed?

6.  If you move a charge of $-3\text{ C}$ from $a$ to $c$ but deviate from a straight line, will your answers to the previous problem change? If no, explain why. If yes, provide new answers.

## Problem -- Radial Field

In the previous problem, a charge was moved in a region of space where the electric field was constant and so the calculation of work did not require integration. In this problem, the electric field is not constant and so integration is required. The type of integration that must be performed to compute work in this case is given by [Equation 23.8 in the textbook](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KO0ETw12uhGYdBMHExKIdR_eCUhHB7dw/view?usp=sharing_remove_).

There is a charge of $-6\text{ C}$ at the origin. Some electric field lines for this charge are shown. To simplify the math, use $k=9\cdot 10^9\text{ N}\cdot \text{m}^2/\text{C}^2$.

1.  You move a charge of $+3\text{ C}$ from $a$ to $b$. (a) How much work did you do? (b) How much work was done by the electric field? (c) By how much has the potential energy of the moved charge changed?

    This is the answer for (b). Note that the work is positive as expected -- the force on the charge is in the same direction as its movement. The work that you do is equal and opposite to the work that the field does. The change in potential is equal and opposite to the work done by the field. In summary, (a) $-27\cdot 10^9\text{ J}$, (b) $+27\cdot 10^9\text{ J}$, (c) $-27\cdot 10^9\text{ J}$. (Use the techniques given in the previous problem to make sure that the signs of these answers are correct.) Note that the answer of $27\cdot 10^9\text{ J}$ is unphysically large; it is the amount of energy that you would need to lift $27\cdot 10^9\text{ kg}$ (about $5$ million elephants) by $1\text{ m}$. 

2.  You move a charge of $-3\text{ C}$ from $a$ to $b$. (a) How much work did you do? (b) How much work was done by the electric field? (c) By how much has the potential energy of the moved charge changed?

3.  You move a charge of $-3\text{ C}$ from $b$ to $c$ along the dotted line. (a) How much work did you do? (b) How much work was done by the electric field? (c) By how much has the potential energy of the moved charge changed?

4. You move a charge of $-3\text{ C}$ from $c$ to $b$ but deviate from the dotted line. (a) How much work did you do? (b) How much work was done by the electric field? (c) By how much has the potential energy of the moved charge changed?

# Electric potential difference, $\Delta V$

In the previous section, we considered moving an arbitrary amount of charge (either positive or negative) from point $a$ to point $b$ and computed its change in potential energy $\Delta U$. 

An electric potential difference $\Delta V$ is defined to be the change in electric potential energy of a (positive by convention) test charge when it is moved from point $a$ to point $b$ divided by the charge on the test charge.

As a result, the only difference between the $\Delta U$ calculations performed previously and $\Delta V$ calculations is that we first compute $\Delta U$ for a $+1\text{ C}$ charge. To get $\Delta V$, we simply divide by $\Delta U$ by $+1\text{ C}$.

The definition of electric potential is similar to the definition of electric field in that they both involve consideration of a test charge. That is, the electric field is the force on a test charge divided by the magnitude of the test charge:

$$\mathbf{E} = \frac{\mathbf{F}}{q_o}$$

A change in potential is the change in potential of a  test charge divided by the magnitude of the test charge's charge:

$$\Delta V = \frac{\Delta U}{q_o}$$

The advantage of using changes in electric potential ($\Delta V$) as opposed to changes in electric potential energy ($\Delta U$) of a specific amount of charge is that once the electric potential difference $\Delta V$ is known for a test charge, the change in potential energy for an arbitrary amount of charge $Q$ can be computed by simply multiplying $\Delta V$ and $Q$. This is similar to the advantage of the electric field. If we know the electric field at a given point, we can find the force on an arbitrary charge $Q$ by multiplying $\mathbf{E}$ and $Q$.

# $\Delta U$ and $\Delta V$ and Superposition

The electric potential energy of a charge $q_0$ that is a distance of $r_1$ from a charge $q_1$ is defined to be 

$$
U=k\frac{q_0q_1}{r_1}
$$

In this formula, if the charges have opposite signs then $U$ is negative; if they have the same sign then $U$  is positive. Note that there is a sign associated with the potential energy but the direction of the vector that connects the charges does not matter; the equation for $U$ only involves the values of the charges and the magnitude of the separation distance between them.

Consider next the potential energy of charge $q_0$ when it is a distance $r_1$ from charge $q_1$ and a distance $r_2$ from charge $q_2$. Because potential energy is a scalar and not a vector, the potential energy of $q_0$ is the {\bf algebraic} sum, rather than the vector sum, of the potential energies due to $q_1$ and $q_2$

$$
U=k\frac{q_0q_1}{r_1}+k\frac{q_0q_2}{r_2}
$$

More generally, if there is a group of $N$ charges, the potential energy of charge $q_0$ is

$$
U=k q_0 \sum_{i=1}^N {\frac{q_i}{r_i}}
$$

Similarly, the electric potential at a point in space due to a group of $N$ charges is the {\bf algebraic} sum of the potentials due to each of the charges at that point in space

$$
V=k \sum_{i=1}^N {\frac{q_i}{r_i}}
$$

## Problem

<img src="figures/Assembly_of_Charges.svg"/>

1. What is the potential energy of the charge $q_0$ in the diagram shown? 

2. What is the potential at the position of $q_0$ if that charge were to be removed (i.e., the potential due to charges $q_1$, $q_2$, and $q_3$)? 

3. Can you find the potential energy at the position of $q_0$ if that charge were to be removed? Why or why not? 

4. Explain the difference between potential and potential energy. 

## Problem

Given a point charge $q_1$ at the origin:

1. Write the general equation for the potential of a charge $q$.

2. Find the electric potential, $V$, at $(x,y) = (d,0)$.

3. If a charge $q_2$ is placed at $(x,y) = (d,0)$, find the electric potential, $V$, at $(x,y) = (-d,0)$ (hint - it is the sum of the potentials due to $q_1$ and $q_2$).

4. How much work is required to place $q_3$ at $(x,y) = (-d,0)$? Note that the work required is also referred to as the potential energy, $U$, of $q_3$.

In summary, to find the work required to put a charge $Q$ at point $P$ (or, equivalently, the electric potential energy $U$ of a single charge $Q$ when it is at point $P$), find the potential $V$ at point $P$ due to all of the other charges and then $U = QV$.

# Work Required to Assemble a System of Charges

In the previous problem you computed the work required to move $q_3$ to $(x,y) = (-d,0)$ after $q_2$ was in place. The total work required to assemble the system of three charges is larger than this work because it also took work to move $q_2$ into place. Given a point charge $q_1$ at origin, as in the previous question:

a. how much work is required to move $q_2$ to (x,y) = (d,0)?;

b. how much work is required to move $q_3$ to $(x,y) = (-d,0)$ if only $q_1$ is present?;

c. how much work is required to move $q_3$ to $(x,y) = (-d,0)$ if only $q_2$ is present?

d. The total work required to assemble the system of three charges is the sum of the work from parts a., b., and c. Write the equation for this sum. This sum is known as the total potential energy of the system of charges.
