1. The parts on "the work you do" should be removed. It is difficult to explain how you do negative work, and one runs into many complications (see references).
2. In 1.1, students find $W^E$ and then find $\Delta U$ using $W^E=-\Delta U$. In 2.1, they are given a formula for $U$ and then use it to find $W^E$. Can we be consistent? Perhaps a section on the integration for both cases?
