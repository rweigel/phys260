# Long Current-Carrying Wires

Previously, you have considered the trajectories of charged particles in a given magnetic field. The given magnetic fields were created by currents, which are composed of moving charges.

In general, computing the magnetic field due to an arbitrary current system requires the use of the Biot--Savart law (Ampere’s law can only be used in special cases). 

It can be shown using both the Biot--Savart law and Ampere’s law that the magnitude of the magnetic field $\mathbf{B}$ at a perpendicular distance $r$ from a long and straight wire carrying a current $I$ is $|\mathbf{B}|=\mu_oI/2\pi r$. The direction of $\mathbf{B}$ is given by the right-hand rule covered in class and in the textbook.
 
## Long Wires

In the following diagram current flowing in long wires is shown. On the left, the current flows into the page and the wire extend a large distance into and out of the page. On the right, only a small segment of the long wire is shown. Make clear that these are two separate problems and the coordinate axis applies to both.
 
1.  In the diagram, the $x$ and $y$ directions are shown. What must be the $z$ direction for the coordinate system to be right-handed? (A right-handed coordinate system is one in which the cross product of the $x$ and $y$ unit vectors gives the $z$ unit vector.)

2.  In terms of $I_o$, $r_o$, constants, and unit vectors, find the magnetic field $\mathbf{B}$ at the four locations a., b., c., and d.

The following diagram is identical to the one on the previous page.

4.  If a positively charged particle has a velocity of $v_o\jhat$  at point c., what will be the direction of force on it? State your answer using a unit vector. Assume $v_o$ is positive.

5.  If a positively charged particle has a velocity of $-v_o\jhat$ at point c., what will be the direction of force on it? State your answer using a unit vector. Assume $v_o$ is positive.

If a positively charged particle has a velocity of $v_o\ihat$ at point c., what will be the direction of force on it? State your answer using a unit vector. Assume $v_o$ is positive.

If a positively charged particle has a velocity of $-vo\ihat$ at point c., what will be the direction of force on it? State your answer using a unit vector. Assume $v_o$ is positive.
 
## Forces on current loops

Previously, you computed the direction of force on a moving charged particle due to the magnetic field created by a long wire. In this section, you will compute the direction of force on a charged particle that is moving but also constrained to flow along a wire.
 
In the diagram above, a square loop carries a current $I_w$. Recall that a current is due to charges flowing along a wire with a small velocity.
 
1.  Find the direction of force on each segment of the square loop. Indicate your answer by drawing a vector on the diagram.
 
2.  What is the relative magnitude of the force on the top vs bottom segment? Circle one of the following answers.

    a.  Same

    b.  Force on top is larger than force on bottom.

    c.  Force on bottom is larger than force on top.

3.  Will the loop tend to rotate or translate? If yes, state the direction of translation and/or rotation.

The force on a point charge $q$ moving with a velocity $\mathbf{v}$ is $\mathbf{F}=q \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B}$ (the Lorentz force Law). From this equation, it can be shown that the differential force acting on a small segment of wire of length $dl$ is $d\mathbf{F}=dl \mathbf{I}\times\mathbf{B}$, where $I$ is the current that flows through $dl$. In the following diagram, four small segments of length $dl$ labeled a., b., c., and d. are shown.

4.  Is $|d\mathbf{F}|$ for the differential segment at a. equal to, greater than, or less than $|d\mathbf{F}|$ for the differential segment at b.?

5.  Is $|d\mathbf{F}|$ for the differential segment at c. equal to, greater than, or less than dF for the differential segment at d.?

6.  Use $\mathbf{F}=q \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B}$ to compute the net force on the bottom segment of the current loop. 

7.  Use $\mathbf{F}=q \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B}$ to compute the net force on the right-hand side segment of the current loop.
