Note that the textbook covers Faraday's law before Lenz's law. I typically cover Lenz's law first and then Faradays' law.

Need to write:

1. Discussion of forces to explain "oppose the cause of the effect" in definition.
2. 
1. Cover Faraday's law; re-do some of the Lenz's law problems using Faraday's law. Then do rotating loop case and ask if results are consistent with Lenz's law at various points in time. (Have examples in old Overleaf repo.)
