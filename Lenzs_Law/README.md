Need to write:

1. Determining direction of current using Lorentz force law when loop is moving (or parts of it as in slidewire).

2. Discussion of why Lorentz force law can't be used in case when flux is changing but no parts of loop is moving. (May be too advanced).

3. Cover Faraday's law; re-do some of the Lenz's law problems using Faraday's law. Then do rotating loop case and ask if results are consistent with Lenz's law at various points in time. (Have examples in old Overleaf repo.)
