Title: Sound Intensity Level
```

# Introduction

The intensity of a sound wave, $I$, is the average power carried across a unit area. $I$ has units of Power/Area, or $\text{W}/\text{m}^2$. The intensity of various sources of sound is shown in the third column of the following table.

Because of the intensity values span a very large range, from $0.0000000000001$ to $100$, we define an alternative measure of intensity called the sound intensity level, $\beta$. The equation that relates sound intensity level $I$, with sound intensity, $\beta$, is

$\beta = (10 \text{ dB})\log_{10}\ds\left(\frac{I}{I_o}\right)$

One advantage to using this formula is that its values span a much smaller range, from 0--140 as shown in the second column of the table above.

# Interpreting $\beta$

1. If you increase the sound intensity of a speaker on a TV from $I_1$ to $I_2$ and $I_2/I_1=10$, what is $\beta_2/\beta_1$?
