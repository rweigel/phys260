This video is more about vector fields but is still a fantastic visualization of the concept. Electric fields and Maxwells equations are directly mentioned (around the 6:00 min mark), but may be too advanced for students in anything other than a conceptual capacity. 

# Continuous Charge Distribution

Not the most exciting, but the above video shows how charges are distributed on the surfaces of insulators and conductors. Notice how the charge stays localized near the initial induction point for the pipe, but gets evenly distributed along the surface of the conducting coffee can. 
# Electric Flux

The above video of a Faraday cage is a decent physical demonstration of electric flux. While electric flux is more of a theoretical idea, in the example of the faraday cage, think about the electric flux of a Gaussian surface inside and outside the Faraday cage.

# Enclosed Charge

^Just a bunch of Gauss' law problems. Look pretty standard

Tesla coils are perhaps one of the most impressive examples of electric power, and there are many aspects of a Tesla coil which can provide talking points on the idea of electric potential. The potential difference generated between the top toroid and the ground, the high voltage arcs of electricity, the large potential across the spark gap, etc.

# Capacitance

Naturally occurring lightening is an example of a capacitor. As a difference of charge builds up between the top and bottom of a cloud, as well as the earth, a capacitor is created. 

# Kirchoff's Laws

^kinda jumps into using both

3 phase AC? might be a bit too advanced...

# RC circuits

The gentlemen in the above video use everything except proper lab procedure to demonstrate an RC circuit in action. They first charge a massive capacitor bank, and then discharge the current through a watermelon. The watermelon here acts as the resistor, and when the circuit is completed and the current is able to flow through the melon, the water inside instantly boils causing the watermelon to explode in an awesome display of electric power.

# Lorentz Force

^again, just example problems

It is well known that when a charge particle moves in the presence of a magnetic field, it begins to experience a force known as the Lorentz force. By firing an electron into a region with a constant magnetic field (such as the field produced by a Helmholtz coil), and measuring its orbit and procession, it is possible to derive the charge to mass ratio of an electron.

# Lorentz Force on wires specifically

Same video as 3.10

The setup of the experiment here is simple, but the physics is more complex. A can is placed inside a coil of wire. A very large current is then quickly pulsed through the coil. By Faradayâ€™s Law, a current is then also induced in the opposite direction of the current pulsed through the coil. These two conflicting currents cause a repulsive force between the can and the coil, crushing the can.
