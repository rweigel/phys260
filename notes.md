^This vid could be used for either Capacitance or Electric potential. Tesla coil?

3.7 Capacitance

3.8 Kirchoff's Laws
3 phase AC? might be a bit too advanced...

3.9 RC circuits
electric guitar explanation vid? Taser

3.10 Lorentz Force
Q/m ratio of electron - Also done in lab so reinforces the concepts.

3.11 Lorentz Force on wires specifically
Power lines? Crushing cans
