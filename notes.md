^This vid could be used for either Capacitance or Electric potential. Tesla coil?

# Capacitance

# Kirchoff's Laws
3 phase AC? might be a bit too advanced...

# RC circuits
electric guitar explanation vid? Taser

# Lorentz Force
Q/m ratio of electron - Also done in lab so reinforces the concepts.

# Lorentz Force on wires specifically

Power lines? Crushing cans
