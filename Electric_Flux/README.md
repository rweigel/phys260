I usually describe the equations in the overview quickly and then have them try 2.1 for 5 minutes and go over the solution. A few students will notice that 2.1d is the sum of the fluxes for 2.1a and 2.1b and I mention this in my solution.

Then, I give an example of projecting a vector by reviewing how one computes the gravitational force parallel and perpendicular to an inclined plane. 

After that, I have them try 2.2 for 15 minutes (and tell them that they can choose either normal as long as they show it on a diagram). Then, I go over the solution and then have them work on the problems in part 3 on their own for the rest of the class period.

In the past, students were uncomfortable with the ambiguity of the direction of the normal in part 2. I have not attempted to resolve the ambiguity in the activity but instead left it so that I can address the question. I mention that when we compute magnetic flux, there will be a convention for which one to pick and that in this course, we only compute electric fluxes through closed surfaces, for which there is a convention.
