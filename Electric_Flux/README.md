In the directory Electric_Flux at https://www.overleaf.com/read/btssfxsjgyzr , there is an activity that I plan on using Monday. I have used it before and had some success with it. (The .tex file is auto-generated based on the .md file, so its pdf may look slightly different than the one that is there, which was created directly from the .md file.) 

If you plan on using it an have corrections, feel free to let me know.

I expect to upload solutions in a day or so and there will probably be a few minor changes to the document.

I usually describe the equations in the overview quickly and then have them try 2.1 for 5 minutes and go over the solution. A few students will notice that 2.1d is the sum of the fluxes for 2.1a and 2.1b and I mention this in my solution.

Then, I give an example of projecting a vector by reviewing how one computes the gravitational force parallel and perpendicular to an inclined plane.

After that, I have them try 2.2 for 15 minutes (and tell them that they can choose either normal as long as they show it on a diagram). Then, I go over the solution and then have them work on the problems in part 3 on their own for the rest of the class period.

In the past, a few students were uncomfortable with the ambiguity of the direction of the normal in part 2. I have not attempted to resolve the ambiguity in the activity but instead left it so that I can address the question. I mention that when we compute magnetic flux, there will be a convention for which one to pick and that in this course, we only compute electric fluxes through closed surfaces, for which there is a convention.

I expect that at most 2 students will get to the last problem.

# Notes I

I spent 10 minutes on solving 2.1 for the case where the plane was in the x-y plane. Even with that, about 1/3 of the students had difficulty and did not do more than 2.1. These students need a review of unit vectors, projecting vectors, and drawing diagrams; many left their answers in terms of dot products and/or had flux being a vector and had answers for 2.1.2 that differed from 2.1.3.

Patrick did an example in class where he used the EAcos(angle) formula, which was not covered in this tutorial. (The textbook uses the dot product, E_perp A, and the cos(angle) methods, the first two of which were covered in problem 2.1). Several students used the cos(angle) approach for problem 2.2 with success. One thing I struggle with is the book uses three methods of finding flux but does not address why it uses a given method for a given problem.

One revision that I will make for this activity is that instead of 45 degrees in 3.1, I'll leave it as phi, and then in 3.1d ask for phi=45 degrees. Several students asked me if their answers were correct and I showed them that when phi = 0, they should get the same answer as 2.1. I also showed several students who were unsure of their answer of zero for 3.1d that this was expected using a diagram.

About 1/3 of the students were able to work on all problems.

# Notes II

My experience was similar. Some students automatically went to EAcos even though the tutorial was sort of pushing them towards using unit vectors. Even those who went with unit vectors struggled with using them correctly.

I think the section in 3.1 starting "Recall that i.i=1," etc. should be at the top of the tutorial to remind them how unit vectors are used. Maybe instructors should start out by reviewing these rules and showing some examples of dot products.

One confusing thing was 2.1.2.d where E = E_0 i + E_0 j. In the other examples, E_0 is the magnitude of the E field, but for this case it is not. I think something other than E_0 should be used here.

Students were not good at drawing the "overhead" view, and there wasn't really room for it. Some just skipped the sketch. I think sketching the vectors is important to understanding the dot products. I suggest drawing the x-y coordinates for each case so they have somewhere to do it. That would make it easier for instructors to check it, too.

There were some students -1/3 sounds about right - who breezed through it with little or no difficulty.

> The E_o for 2.1.2.d bothered me too, but I left it because I wanted them to easily see that the answer could be found from earlier parts and superposition. In the future, I'll try (1/sqrt(2)) (E_o ihat + E_o jhat).

> I agree that the overhead view drawing is important and I sort of assumed it would be easy (in an earlier version I didn't ask them to draw it because it seemed too obvious to ask). I'll have to make a note to review it on the board and also give an example or two that shows it. They'll definitely need it when the problem of a rotating square in a B field is covered.

> I often feel that we give them too many different ways to do something, where teaching one method more thoroughly might be more helpful. I'm not sure if we did unit vectors at all in my intro physics class! We might have just stuck with ABcos, though we certainly learned the component method (AxBx+AyBy+AzBz) too.

> For most of the problems for electric flux, one can get away with using only 3. I think I used 1. because I was anticipating problems where vector notation is heavily used (but this is in cross products).

> Forms 2. and 4. are useful for interpretation - I typically start out with an analogy of points flowing horizontally and passing through a line at an angle and then show a new drawing with a vertical line and arguing that the flow is the same through both. I suppose instead of having them do a calculation, we could have a problem where they are asked if the flux through the area that is perpendicular is the same as that through the larger area that is at an angle. This way we make sure that they can compute the flux and understand the reason for the cos(angle).
