This 10--minute activity is intended for use on the first day of class to determine which students need help with basic vector notation and trigonometry.

I send emails to students who had difficulty with these problems with the recommendation that based on past experience, they will need to start meeting with an LA or tutor on a weekly basis in order to have a chance of passing.
