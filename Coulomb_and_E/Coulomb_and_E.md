**Electric Force**

*Magnitude*: $\displaystyle F=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_o}\frac{|q_1q_2|}{r^2}$

*Direction*: Force is along line that connects $q_1$ and $q_2$. Direction depends on signs of $q_1$ and $q_2$. (Likes repel, opposites attract.) $r$ is separation distance. Sometimes $k$ is used in place of the proportionality constnat $1/4\pi\epsilon_o$.

**Electric Field**

Compute force on a charge $q$ due to all other charges. Then remove the $q$ by dividing by it.

$$\mathbf{E} = \frac{\mathbf{F}}{q}$$

To find when a different charge $Q$ is placed where $q$ was, multiply $\mathbf{E}$ by $Q$.

# Electric Force

Charge $q_1$ is at $(x, y) = (a, a)$. Charge $q_2$ is at $(x, y) = (a, 2a)$. Draw this charge configuration on the provided graph paper.

1. Find the magnitude of the force that $q_1$ exerts on $q_2$. Show your work in the space below. Compare your result with the members of your group and make sure that you agree.

2. Find the direction of the force that $q_1$ exerts on $q_2$. Express your answer as an angle with respect to the $x$-axis, with counterclockwise rotation being positive. Show your work in the space below.

Draw the two charges described above three times in the space below and label them 3., 4., and 5. Draw arrows to indicate the directions of movement.

3. If $q_1$ and $q_2$ are both positive, in what directions will each move if released?

4. If $q_1$ and $q_2$ are both negative, in what directions will each move if released?

5. If $q_1$ and $q_2$ have opposite signs, in what directions will each move if released?

# Electric Field

Charge $q_1$ is at $(x, y) = (a, a)$.

1. Find the magnitude of the electric field at $(x, y) = (a, 2a)$. Show your work. Compare what you got with the other students in the group.

<div style="height:4em"/>

2. Find the direction of the electric field at $(x, y) = (a, 2a)$ if $q_1$ is positive. Express your answer as an angle with respect to the $x$-axis, with counterclockwise rotation being positive. Show your work.

<div style="height:4em"/>

3. Write an equation for the electric field at $(x, y) = (a, 2a)$ in vector notation (e.g., $\mathbf{E} = E_x\ihat + E_y\jhat$). Is your answer what you would have expected based on your answer to part 2.? Explain.  

<div style="height:4em"/>

4. If a charge $q_2$ is placed at $(a, 2a)$, what will be the electric force that is exerted on it? Express your answer in vector notation ($\mathbf{F}=F_x\ihat+F_y\jhat$). 

<div style="height:4em"/>

5. If charges $q_1$ and $q_2$ are positive, in what directions will the charges move? Explain using your answer to part 4.

<div style="height:4em"/>

6. Charge $q_1 = q$ is at $(x, y) = (a, 0)$, charge $q_2 = -q$ is at $(x, y) = (-a, 0)$, and charge $q_3 = -q$ is at $(x, y) = (0, a)$. Assume $q$ is positive. Draw this charge configuration on the provided graph paper.

<div style="height:4em"/>

7. Find the electric field vector at the origin in the form $\mathbf{E} = E_x\ihat + E_y\jhat$. Show your work in the space below. Discuss the symmetry in the problem and how it impacts your answer. 

<div style="height:4em"/>

8. Explain the difference between electric field and electric force. Why it does not make sense to ask what the electric force is at the origin.

9. If a positive charge $q_o$ is placed at the origin, what will be the force (in vector notation) exerted on it? Which direction will the charge $q_o$ move if released?
