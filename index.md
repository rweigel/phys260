# Overview

These are activities that students work on during a weekly 50--minute recitation for PHYS 260 at GMU. To maximize time that students spend working on problems, I typically give at most a 10--minute review. Often, my 10--minute overview involves working through an example that is nearly identical to the first problem. If many students are stuck on a part of the problem, I will interrupt the class and have students guide to the answer.

These tutorials were written in collaboration with Jessica Rosenberg over the course of four semesters. The tutorials were revised from semester-to-semester based on observations made while using them.

The length of the tutorials are such that 1--2 students out of 30 will finish completely. 

%**Motivation**

%In the past, I would solve problems at the board for 40 minutes and then give a quiz at the end. The quiz required students to reproduce something that I had expained several times or to reproduce the set--up of a problem. Based on the results of these very simple quizes, few students got much out of my presentation. In addition, often students would ask for help on homework problems after the recitation that were nearly identical to the problem covered in recitation. It was clear from their questions that their notes from, or memory of, my presentation were of little use.

%Prior to working on these, approximately 1/2--2/3 of the students will have attended two 75--minute lectures covering the associated chapter and content.

%The problems on these activities are generally basic and simple. They emphasis the basic calculations required to solve problems rather than concepts. I generally explain the concepts and ask questions about them while the students are solving problems or when I go over a solution.

%However, I find that most students only have time to attempt half of the problems and there are many questions. Based on experience, I assume that after two 75--minute lectures, most students have only knowledge of keywords and associated concepts and are not able to solve problems that require more than identifying the equation to use given variables in the problem statement.

%For my recitations, students turn in their work at the end of class and I hand out solutions. The minimum score for their work is 7/10 points. Scores below a 10 are for students who made little progress and did not ask questions or work with others. I typically indicate wrong answers but do not take points off unless almost everything is very wrong. I also hand out solutions at the end of class and tell students that in order to have any chance of a passing score on the exams, they must have mastered the problems in this tutorial prior to exams. I also encourage them to review by re--solving the tutorial problems again without referring to their previous work or solutions.

In each subdirectory at https://github.com/rweigel/phys260 there is a file named `README.md` with notes written after class and after reviewing student work.

The figures were created using [MathCha](https://www.mathcha.io/). To edit using MathCha, open the MathCha links in the comments in the `.md` or `.tex` file. The `.tikz` files can also be edited using a [tikz editor](https://www.google.com/search?q=tikz+editor).

The master document is the `.md` file, which is converted to `.html` and `.tex`. The `.pdf` files are based on the `.html` file. The `.tex` files are auto--generated from the `.md` files and a `.pdf` created with the `.tex` file may look different than the one stored in the repository.
