# Overview

These are activities that students work on during a weekly 50--minute recitation for PHYS 260. To maximize time that students spend working on problems, I typically give at most a 10--minute review. Often, my 10--minute overview involves working through an example that is nearly identical to the first problem.

%The motivation for this style of recitation is that in the past, I would solve problems at the board for 45 minutes and then give a quiz at the end. Based on the results of the (very simple) quizes, few students got much out of my presentation. In addition, often students would ask for help on homework problems after the recitation that were nearly identical to the problem covered in recitation. It was clear from their questions that their notes from, or memory of, my presentation were of little use.

%Prior to working on these, approximately 1/2--2/3 of the students will have attended two 75--minute lectures covering the associated chapter and content.

%The problems on these activities are generally basic and simple. However, I find that most students only have time to attempt half of the problems and there are many questions. Based on experience, I assume that after two 75--minute lectures, most students have only knowledge of keywords and associated concepts and are not able to solve problems that require more than identifying the equation to use given variables in the problem statement.

%Students turn in their work at the end of class and I hand out solutions. The minimum score for their work is 7/10 points.

1. Electric Force Between Point Charges (Coulomb's Law)
    * [Activity](Electric_Force/Electric_Force.md) 
    * [Instructor Notes](Electric_Force/Electric_Force_Notes.md) 
    * Covers using Coulomb's law to find the electric force vector using the simple form of Coulomb's law (see next activity).
    * Covered in [Section 21.3 of Young and Freedman 2015, 14th Edition](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JS_pBuNEwXdz9IzpSBFPJffgVacZmqN7/view?usp=sharing_remove_)

1. Review of Vectors using Coulomb's Law
    * [Activity](Vectors/Vectors.md) 
    * [Source Files and Notes](https://github.com/rweigel/phys260/tree/master/Vectors) 
    * In Section 21.4, a compact vector form of the electric field due to a point charge is given. However, in Section 21.3, the compact form is not used for Coulomb's Law. In this activity, students use both forms for problems involving Coulomb's law.

1. Electric Field of a Point Charge
    * [Activity](Electric_Field/Electric_Field.md) 
    * [Instructor Notes](Electric_Field/Electric_Field_Notes.md) 
    * Covers computing the electric field due to one and three point charges.
    * Covered in [Section 21.4 of Young and Freedman 2015, 14th Edition](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JS_pBuNEwXdz9IzpSBFPJffgVacZmqN7/view?usp=sharing_remove_)

2. Electric Flux
    * [Activity](Electric_Flux/Electric_Flux.md)

    1. The area vector for an open surface (rectangle) and computing $\mathbf{E}\bfcdot d\mathbf{A}$ when the angle between $\mathbf{E}$ and $d\mathbf{A}$ is constant.
    2. The area vectors for a closed surface (cube) and computing $\mathbf{E}\bfcdot d\mathbf{A}$ for each surface.
    3. In 1. and 2., then angle between $\mathbf{E}$ and $\mathbf{A}$ is $0, 90, 180,$ or $270$ degrees. Here the angle is arbitrary.
