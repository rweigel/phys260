# Conservation of energy (Ch 23)

A small (blue) sphere, $q_1$, with a net charge of $-3.0\thickspace\mu\text{C}$ is suspended from an insulating thread and cannot move. A second small sphere (yellow, $q_2$) with a net charge of $-8.0\thickspace\mu\text{C}$ and a mass of $2.0\thickspace\text{g}$ is shot towards the blue sphere. When the two spheres are a distance $r_1 = 1.0\text{ m}$ apart, the speed of $q_2$ is $v_2 = 20.0\text{ m/s}$. Assume that the two spheres can be treated as points and gravity is negligible.

1. Describe the motion of $q_2$ over time and explain why. Does everyone in your group agree? Try to come to a consensus on what will happen. If you can’t, talk to your instructor. 

2. Describe why you might want to use conservation of energy to determine the velocity of $q_2$ at a distance of $0.5\text{ m}$ and the distance of closest approach between $q_1$ and $q_2$. Does everyone in your group have the same reasons? Discuss similarities and differences in your answers. 

3. What types of energy does $q_2$ possess when the charges are $1.0\text{ m}$ apart? Write down the equation that describes the energy of $q_2$ when the charges are $1.0\text{ m}$ apart. Express your answer in terms of $m$, $k$, $v_1$, $q_1$, $q_2$, and $r_1$. After finding this answer, solve for the energy of $q_2$ when the charges are $1.0\text{ m}$ apart.

What is the energy of $q_2$ when the charges are $0.5\text{ m}$ apart? Do not substitute in numbers –- express your answer in terms of $m$, $k$, $v_2$, $q_1$, $q_2$, and $r_1$.

What is the speed, $v_2$, of charge $q_2$ when the charges are $r_2 = 0.5\text{ m}$ apart? Write your answer first in terms of the variables and put a box around that answer and then solve for the actual speed. Note that when you solve problems with numbers this is how you should do it -– get your final answer in terms of the variables in the equation and only then substitute in numbers. 

Describe what happens to the energy of $q_2$ when it reaches its closest point to $q_1$. Write the equation for the energy of $q_2$ at its closest point to $q_1$ here. No numbers! Clearly define any new variables that you need.

Calculate the closest distance $q_2$ gets to $q_1$. Yes, numbers are allowed! Hint: earlier answers might be helpful here so you don’t have to recalculate all of the numbers -– which values can you use from previous parts of this problem?
