# Conservation of energy (Ch 23)

A small (blue) sphere, $q_1$, with a net charge of $-3.0\thickspace\mu\text{C}$ is suspended from an insulating thread and cannot move. A second small sphere (yellow, $q_2$) with a net charge of $-8.0\thickspace\mu\text{C}$ and a mass of $2.0\thickspace\text{g}$ is shot towards the blue sphere. When the two spheres are a distance $r_1 = 1.0\text{ m}$ apart, the speed of $q_2$ is $v_2 = 20.0\text{ m/s}$. Assume that the two spheres can be treated as points and gravity is negligible.

1. Describe the motion of $q_2$ over time and explain why. Does everyone in your group agree? Try to come to a consensus on what will happen. If you can’t, talk to your instructor. 

2. Describe why you might want to use conservation of energy to determine the velocity of $q_2$ at a distance of $0.5\text{ m}$ and the distance of closest approach between $q_1$ and $q_2$. Does everyone in your group have the same reasons? Discuss similarities and differences in your answers. 

3. What types of energy does $q_2$ possess when the charges are $1.0\text{ m}$ apart? Write down the equation that describes the energy of $q_2$ when the charges are $1.0\text{ m}$ apart. Express your answer in terms of $m$, $k$, $v_1$, $q_1$, $q_2$, and $r_1$. After finding this answer, solve for the energy of $q_2$ when the charges are $1.0\text{ m}$ apart.

What is the energy of $q_2$ when the charges are $0.5\text{ m}$ apart? Do not substitute in numbers –- express your answer in terms of $m$, $k$, $v_2$, $q_1$, $q_2$, and $r_1$.

What is the speed, $v_2$, of charge $q_2$ when the charges are $r_2 = 0.5\text{ m}$ apart? Write your answer first in terms of the variables and put a box around that answer and then solve for the actual speed. Note that when you solve problems with numbers this is how you should do it -– get your final answer in terms of the variables in the equation and only then substitute in numbers. 

Describe what happens to the energy of $q_2$ when it reaches its closest point to $q_1$. Write the equation for the energy of $q_2$ at its closest point to $q_1$ here. No numbers! Clearly define any new variables that you need.

Calculate the closest distance $q_2$ gets to $q_1$. Yes, numbers are allowed! Hint: earlier answers might be helpful here so you don’t have to recalculate all of the numbers -– which values can you use from previous parts of this problem?

# Capacitance (Ch 25)
 
## Overview

The general technique for computing capacitance when Gauss's law applies is:

1. Place an equal and opposite amount of charge on the conductors.
2. Use Gauss's law to compute the electric field between the conductors.
3. Use $V(b)-V(a)=-\int^b_a \mathbf{E}\bfcdot d\mathbf{l}$ to find the potential difference between the conductors.
4. Use the equation for capacitance to find $C$: $C = Q/|\Delta V| = Q/|V(b)-V(a)|$.

## Parallel Plate

An equal and opposite amount of charge is placed on two conducting and parallel plates as shown on the left in the following figure. On the right, a side view of the plates is shown. The area of the plates, $A = w^2$, is much larger than shown such that the width, $w$, is much larger than the separation distance, $d$.

1. How will the charges distribute on each of the plates? That is, how much charge is on each of the four faces that have area $A$? Assume that no charge appears on the other (narrow, and having thickness $t$) faces of the plates, which have a much smaller area. 

2. What is the electric field in each of the five regions? (Hint: Use the equation for the field outside of a large and uniformly charged sheet and account for the field due to the charges on the surface of each plate, which was derived using Gauss’s law.) 

3. How much work would it take to move a charge qo from the left plate to the right plate (i.e., the distance d shown)? Said another way, what is the difference in electric potential energy, $U_r-U_l$, between the right and left plate?
 
4. How much work does it take to move a charge qo from the outer face of a plate to the inner face of the same plate? (Hint: What is the electric field inside of the plates?) 

5. What is the electric potential difference, $V_r – V_l$ , between the left and right plate?
 
6. What is the electric potential difference between the inner and outer faces of one of the plates?

7. Write the capacitance in terms of $k$, $A$, and $d$.

8. Explain why the thickness of the plates does not appear in the equation for capacitance.

## Spherical

Charge is uniformly distributed on two spherical conducting shells, the cross--section of which is shown. Both shells have a thickness of $t$. The inner shell has an outer radius of $a$ and a net charge of $-Q$. The outer shell has an inner radius of $b$ and a net charge of $+Q$. Assume that $Q$ is positive.

1. Use Gauss's law to show that there can be no charge on the inner surface of the inner conductor. 

2. Use Gauss's law again to show that the charge on the inner surface of the outer conductor is $+Q$. 

3. Show that there is no charge on the outer surface of the outer conductor.
 
4. What is the electric field in each of the 5 labeled regions? Region 1. is the empty volume inside of the inner conductor, region 2. is the volume of the inner conductor, region 3. is the empty volume between the conductors, region 4. is the volume of the outer conductor, and region 5. is the region outside of the outer conductor. (Hint: Use Gauss's law several times.)
 
5. How much work will it take to move a charge qo from the outer surface of the inner shell to the inner surface of the outer shell? Said another way, what is the difference in electric potential, Ub -Ua?
 
6. What is the potential difference, $V(b) - V(a)$?

7. Write the capacitance in terms of $k$, $A$, and $d$.


# Electric Current (Ch 26)

3.  What is the current (with units) in the wire?

4.  What is the current density (with units) that flows through the wire?

5.  What is the drift velocity of electrons in the wire? (The charge on an electron is $-1.6·10^{-19}\text{ C}$.)

##
 
A battery is connected to a wire of length $20$ meters with circular cross section and a radius of $0.01$ meters. The wire has a resistivity of $10^{-7}\Omega\cdot\text{m}$. The density of charge carriers is $10^{27}/\text{m}^3$. The current in the wire was measured and found to be $1$ Ampere.

1.  What is the resistance (with units) of the wire?

2.  How much charge flows past a cross section of the wire per second?

3.  What is voltage of the battery (with units)?

4.  What is the drift velocity of electrons in the wire? (The charge on an electron is $-1.6\cdot 10^{-19}\text{ C}.)

# Kirchhoff’s Circuit Laws (Ch 27)
 
To find the current through each resistor in a circuit with batteries and resistors, Kirchhoff’s Current Law and Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law can be used. 

1.  Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law (KVL): The algebraic sum of all voltage drops around a closed loop must equal zero.
2.  Kirchhoff’s Current Law (KCL): The algebraic sum of all currents entering and exiting a node must equal zero.
 
## Single Loop Circuit

In a single loop circuit, only KVL is needed to find the current.

Assume the direction of current $I$ in the above circuit is counterclockwise. Write the equation for KVL and then solve for $$.

Assume the direction of current $I$ in the following circuit is clockwise. Write the equation for KVL and then solve for $I$.

Which value for $I$ found above is correct?

## Multiple Loop Circuit

Assume the direction of currents $I_1$, $I_2$, and $I_3$ in the following circuit are as shown.

1.  Write the equation for KVL for loop A.

2.  Write the equation for KVL for loop B. 

3.  Write the equation for KCL for node X.

Use the three equations found above to solve for the three unknowns, $I_1$, $I_2$, and $I_3$.

## Redundant KVL Equations

###

In the circuit for part II., there are three possible loops. The third loop is loop C. indicated below. 

1.  Write the equation for KVL for loop C. 

2.  Use the equation for KVL for loop B. and the KCL equation for node X from Part II with the KVL equation for loop C to find $I_1$, $I_2$, and $I_3$.

###

When solving circuit problems with multiple loops, you will generally find that you can use KVL and KCL to write more equations than there are unknowns. If you encounter a situation where you wrote $N$ equations based on KVL and KCL but cannot find $N$ unknows, the reason is that two or more of the $N$ equations that you wrote were not independent. To demonstrate this, for the circuit below,

1.  Write the KCL equation for node X

2.  Write the KCL equation for node Y

3.  Write the KVL equation for loop A
 
4.  Attempt to use the above three equations to solve for $I_1$, $I_2$, and $I_3$.
 
# Long Current-Carrying Wires (Ch 28)

Magnets sorting nails https://imgur.com/gallery/qxoTVRA

Previously, you have considered the trajectories of charged particles in a given magnetic field. The given magnetic fields were created by currents, which are composed of moving charges.

In general, computing the magnetic field due to an arbitrary current system requires the use of the Biot--Savart law (Ampere’s law can only be used in special cases). 

It can be shown using both the Biot--Savart law and Ampere’s law that the magnitude of the magnetic field $\mathbf{B}$ at a perpendicular distance $r$ from a long and straight wire carrying a current $I$ is $|\mathbf{B}|=\mu_oI/2\pi r$. The direction of $\mathbf{B}$ is given by the right-hand rule covered in class and in the textbook.
 
## Long Wires

In the following diagram current flowing in long wires is shown. On the left, the current flows into the page and the wire extend a large distance into and out of the page. On the right, only a small segment of the long wire is shown. Make clear that these are two separate problems and the coordinate axis applies to both.
 
1.  In the diagram, the $x$ and $y$ directions are shown. What must be the $z$ direction for the coordinate system to be right-handed? (A right-handed coordinate system is one in which the cross product of the $x$ and $y$ unit vectors gives the $z$ unit vector.)

2.  In terms of $I_o$, $r_o$, constants, and unit vectors, find the magnetic field $\mathbf{B}$ at the four locations a., b., c., and d.

The following diagram is identical to the one on the previous page.

4.  If a positively charged particle has a velocity of $v_o\jhat$  at point c., what will be the direction of force on it? State your answer using a unit vector. Assume $v_o$ is positive.

5.  If a positively charged particle has a velocity of $-v_o\jhat$ at point c., what will be the direction of force on it? State your answer using a unit vector. Assume $v_o$ is positive.

If a positively charged particle has a velocity of $v_o\ihat$ at point c., what will be the direction of force on it? State your answer using a unit vector. Assume $v_o$ is positive.

If a positively charged particle has a velocity of $-vo\ihat$ at point c., what will be the direction of force on it? State your answer using a unit vector. Assume $v_o$ is positive.
 
## Forces on current loops

Previously, you computed the direction of force on a moving charged particle due to the magnetic field created by a long wire. In this section, you will compute the direction of force on a charged particle that is moving but also constrained to flow along a wire.
 
In the diagram above, a square loop carries a current $I_w$. Recall that a current is due to charges flowing along a wire with a small velocity.
 
1.  Find the direction of force on each segment of the square loop. Indicate your answer by drawing a vector on the diagram.
 
2.  What is the relative magnitude of the force on the top vs bottom segment? Circle one of the following answers.

    a.  Same

    b.  Force on top is larger than force on bottom.

    c.  Force on bottom is larger than force on top.

3.  Will the loop tend to rotate or translate? If yes, state the direction of translation and/or rotation.

The force on a point charge $q$ moving with a velocity $\mathbf{v}$ is $\mathbf{F}=q \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B}$ (the Lorentz force Law). From this equation, it can be shown that the differential force acting on a small segment of wire of length $dl$ is $d\mathbf{F}=dl \mathbf{I}\times\mathbf{B}$, where $I$ is the current that flows through $dl$. In the following diagram, four small segments of length $dl$ labeled a., b., c., and d. are shown.

4.  Is $|d\mathbf{F}|$ for the differential segment at a. equal to, greater than, or less than $|d\mathbf{F}|$ for the differential segment at b.?

5.  Is $|d\mathbf{F}|$ for the differential segment at c. equal to, greater than, or less than dF for the differential segment at d.?

6.  Use $\mathbf{F}=q \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B}$ to compute the net force on the bottom segment of the current loop. 

7.  Use $\mathbf{F}=q \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B}$ to compute the net force on the right-hand side segment of the current loop.

# Lenz's Law (Ch 29)

## Introduction

In this section we get our first look at the connection between magnetic and electric fields. A changing magnetic flux can {\it induce} the flow of a current in a conducting loop. 

As a reminder, the general equation for magnetic flux is:

$$
\Phi_B = \int \mathbf{B}\cdot d\mathbf{A}
$$

If the magnitude (strength) of the magnetic field is not changing and the angle between the magnetic field vector and the area vector doesn't change over the surface, then integration is not required and we can write

$$
\Phi_B = \mathbf{B}\cdot \mathbf{A}
$$

or, equivalently,

$$
\Phi_B = BA\cos\phi
$$

See the previous tutorial for examples that demonstrate the use of this equation.

There are three ways in which flux can change:

1.  The magnitude of $\mathbf{B}$ can change. To do this, a magnet can be moved closer or farther away from a conducting loop, a loop can be moved closer or farther away from a magnet, or the current in the loop that is generating the magnetic field can be changed. See Example 29.1 in the textbook for an example of the creation of a changing magnetic field without a magnet.
    
2.  The area $A$ can change. To do this, the loop cross-section can be expanded or contracted, either by heating or cooling a wire or, more commonly, using a device called a slidewire generator (see Example 29.5).
    
3.  The angle can change. To do this, a conducting loop can be rotated (see Example 29.3). This is important in motors. 

In this tutorial, you will first determine the direction of the induced current using Lenz's law. After becoming familiar with the direction of the induced current, we will use Faraday's law to explore the induced emf that drives the induced current. 

Lenz's law follows from Faraday's law. In principle, Faraday's law with careful attention paid to signs can be used to determine the direction of induced current, in which case Lenz's law is not needed. In a similar way that using the right--hand rules to get the general direction for force can be used to check your math on a cross-product, Lenz's Law provides a check on the direction of the induced current when using Faraday's law. 

## Lenz's Law

As described in the textbook,

{\bf Lenz’s Law:} The direction of any magnetic induction effect is such as to oppose the cause of the effect.

Here, we'll use a simpler definition.

{\bf Lenz’s Law alternative}: When the external magnetic flux through a conducting loop changes, a current appears (is induced) in the loop. This induced current creates an induced magnetic field. The direction of the induced current is such that the magnetic field it creates attempts to keep the magnetic flux unchanged.

## Example 2.1

A spatially uniform external magnetic field points out of the page and its magnitude is increasing in time.

Assume that the area vector, which is normal to the gray cross-sectional area of rectangular conducting loop, is out of the page.

\input{EMF and Induced Fields/figures/Square_Loop_I}

1.  Is the magnetic flux through the loop increasing or decreasing? 

2.  What is the direction of an induced magnetic field, through the gray region, that will counteract the change in the magnetic flux? Is the direction of the induced magnetic field positive or negative?

3.  What would the direction of the current in the loop have to be to induce a magnetic field in the direction you got in part b? This is the direction of the induced current.  

4.  If you assume that the normal direction of the cross-sectional area of loop is into the page, will your answers change?

{\bf Answer}:

1.  The magnetic field is in the same direction of as the normal, so $\Phi_B=\mathbf{B}_{ext}\cdot \mathbf{A}=\mathbf{B}_{ext}\cdot A\hat{\mathbf{n}}$ is positive. The flux is increasing. 

2.  A \emph{induced} magnetic field, that counteracts the increasing magnetic flux, would have to be pointed into the page. A magnetic field that counteracts the increasing magnetic flux would be in the negative direction.

3.  By the right-hand rule, to create a magnetic field into the page would require a clockwise current.

4.  The sign of the magnetic fluxes will change but the current direction that follows from Lenz's law will be the same.

## Problem

A spatially uniform external magnetic field points into of the page and its magnitude is decreasing in time.

Assume that the normal direction of the cross-sectional area of loop is out of the page.

\input{EMF and Induced Fields/figures/Square_Loop_II}

1.  Is the magnetic flux through the loop increasing or decreasing? 

2.  What direction would an induced magnetic field have to be to oppose the change in the magnetic flux? Would the direction of the induced magnetic field be positive or negative? 

3.  What would the direction of the current in the loop have to be to induce a magnetic field in the direction you got in part b? This is the direction of the induced current. 

4.  If you assume that the normal direction of the cross-sectional area of loop is into the page, will your answers change?

{\bf Answer}:

1.  The magnetic field is in the opposite direction of as the normal, so $\Phi_B=\mathbf{B}_{ext}\cdot \mathbf{A}=\mathbf{B}_{ext}\cdot A\hat{\mathbf{n}}$ is negative. However, the external magnetic field is decreasing with time so the magnetic flux is increasing (the magnetic flux is large an negative initially; because $B_{ext}$ is decreasing with time, after a short amount of time the flux is still negative but closer to zero). Another way of working this out is to consider the derivative of flux: $\Phi_B=-B_{ext}A$, $d \Phi_B/dt = -AdB_{ext}/dt$. Here $dB_{ext}/dt$ is given to be negative, so $\Phi_B/dt$ is positive. 

(b) A \emph{induced} magnetic field, that will create a flux that counteracts the increasing magnetic flux, would have to be pointed into the page. The induced magnetic flux is thus negative.

(c) By the right-hand rule, to create an induced magnetic field into the page requires a clockwise current.

(d) The sign of the magnetic fluxes will change but the current direction that follows from Lenz's law will be the same.

## Example 2.2

A spatially uniform external magnetic field points out of the page and it is not changing with time.

The conducting loop is heated causing the gray cross-sectional area to increase with time.

Assume that the normal direction of the gray cross-sectional area of loop is out of the page.

\input{EMF and Induced Fields/figures/Square_Loop_I}

1.  Is the magnetic flux through the loop increasing or decreasing? 

2.  What direction would an induced magnetic field have to be to oppose the change in the magnetic flux? Would the direction of the induced magnetic field be positive or negative? 

3.  What would the direction of the current in the loop have to be to induce a magnetic field in the direction you got in part b? This is the direction of the induced current. 

4.  If you assume that the normal direction of the cross-sectional area of loop is into the page, will your answers change?

{\bf Answer}:

1.  The magnetic flux is $\Phi_B=\mathbf{B}_{ext}\cdot \mathbf{A}=\mathbf{B}_{ext}\cdot A\hat{\mathbf{n}}$ = $B_{ext}A$. Here $A$ is increasing, so the magnetic flux is increasing.

2.  An induced magnetic field into the page will create a negative flux to counteract the increase in flux.

3.  A clockwise current creates a magnetic field into the page.

4.  The sign of the magnetic fluxes will change. The direction of current will not change.

## Problem

An external magnetic field points into of the page and it is not changing with time.

Assume that the normal direction of the cross-sectional area of loop is out of the page.

The conducting loop of area $A$ is cooled and as a result its cross-sectional area decreases with time.

\input{EMF and Induced Fields/figures/Square_Loop_II}

1.  Is the magnetic flux through the loop increasing or decreasing? 

2.  What direction would an induced magnetic field have to be to oppose the change in the magnetic flux? Would the direction of the induced magnetic field be positive or negative? 

3.  What would the direction of the current in the loop have to be to induce a magnetic field in the direction you got in part b? This is the direction of the induced current. 

4.  If you assume that the normal direction of the cross-sectional area of loop is into the page, will your answers change?

{\bf Answer}:

1.  The magnetic flux is $\Phi_B=\mathbf{B}_{ext}\cdot \mathbf{A}=\mathbf{B}_{ext}\cdot A\hat{\mathbf{n}}$. Here the magnetic field is in the opposite direction of the normal so $\mathbf{B}_{ext}\cdot A\hat{\mathbf{n}}$ is negative. The area $A$ is decreasing so the magnetic flux, which is initially negative, is increasing towards zero. 

2.  The induced magnetic field would have to be into the page. The induced magnetic field would be in the direction opposite of the chosen normal direction for the loop.

3.  By the right-hand rule, a clockwise current creates a magnetic field into the page. This direction of induced current is such that its associated induced magnetic field is attempting to keep the magnetic flux unchanged.

4.  The sign of magnetic fluxes will change, the direction of the current will not change.

%To understand the direction a current will be induced in a wire, one can start by considering the magnetic forces on charges on a conductor that is moving within the field. 

%Note: we will discuss later that this is only part of the explanation and cannot explain the motion of charges when the conductor is not moving (but the field is still changing). 

## Induced Currents and the Lorentz Force Law

Lenz's law can only be used to determine the direction a current will flow in response to a changing magnetic flux through a conducting loop. It does not explain why currents start to flow. The currents flow due to one of two forces. These forces are 

* The Lorentz force, which says that a charge moving in a magnetic field experiences a force according to $\mathbf{F}=q\mathbf{v}\times\mathbf{B}$. An example of this was given in Example 2.2 and 2.3. In both cases, the charges on the conductor are moving in a magnetic field and as a result, they will experience a Lorentz Force that initiates the flow of current.

* An induced electric field. In Example 2.1, the conductor is not moving and so its velocity is zero. But an induced current still appears. We must conclude that there is an induced electric field that causes the current to flow.

## Example

A conducting loop is moving in a spatially uniformmagnetic field. 
\input{EMF and Induced Fields/figures/Moving_Loop}

1.  What is the direction of Lorentz force on the electrons in each segment of the wire?

2.  Based on the result of (1), do you expect a current to flow?

3.  Based on Lenz's law, do you expect a current to flow?

{\bf Answer}:

1.  Upwards on all sides. 

2.  The magnetic force will not cause the charges to rotate around the loop. 

3.  No current is expected because the magnetic flux through the loop is not changing.

## Problem

A conducting bar slides along a U-shaped conducting wire as shown in a region of space where an external magnetic field is spatially uniform.

\input{EMF and Induced Fields/figures/Slide_Wire}

1.  What is the direction of Lorentz force on the electrons in each segment of the wire?

    {\bf Answer}:

    The Lorentz force will be zero on all sides (because $\mathbf{v}=0$) except for the moving wire. On the moving wire, $\mathbf{v}\times \mathbf{B}_{ext}$ is downwards (with a small component to the left because the velocity in the Lorentz force equation contains the velocity of the charge as it moves along the wire). The force on an electron will be in the opposite direction. 

2.  Based on the result of (1), do you expect a current to flow?

    {\bf Answer}: Clockwise.

3.  Based on Lenz's law, do you expect a current to flow? If yes, (a) in what direction and (b) is this direction consistent with your answer to 2.?

    {\bf Answer}:

    Yes, the current is expected to flow clockwise. If the normal to the loop is out of the page, the magnetic flux through the loops is increasing; a clockwise current creates a negative magnetic flux.

1.  A copper wire loop is placed in a uniform magnetic field as shown. Determine whether there would be a current through the wire of the loop in each case below. {\bf Explain your answer in terms of magnetic forces exerted on the charges in the wire of the loop.} Recall that the magnitude of field lines is proportional to their spacing.
    1.  The loop is stationary.

    {\bf Answer}:

    If the loop is stationary, there are no moving charges so there is no Lorentz force on the charges and hence no current is induced in the loop.

    2.  The loop is moving to the right.

    {\bf Answer}:

    $$
    {\bf F} = q{\bf v} \times {\bf B}
    $$

    Both $\mathbf{v}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ are in the $\xhat$ direction so 
$v\hat{\bf x} \times B\hat{\bf x} = 0$.So no force and thus no current. 

    3.  The loop is moving to the left.

    {\bf Answer}:

    $$
    {\bf F} = q{\bf v} \times {\bf B}
    $$

    Both $\mathbf{v}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ are in the $\hat{\bf x}$ direction so 

    $$
    v (-\hat{\bf x}) \times B\hat{\bf x} = vb(-\hat{\bf x} \times \hat{\bf x}) = 0
    $$

    So no force and thus no current. 

## Problem

1.  In the figure above, there is a current running through a long straight wire as shown. For each conducting loop A-D determine:

    1.  The direction (clockwise or counterclockwise or zero) for the current induced in each loop.

    {\bf Answer}:

    A. no current

    B. clockwise

    C. clockwise

    D. no current

    2.  The direction of the net force on the loop – explain your reasoning.

    {\bf Answer}:

    A. no force -- there is no movement in a direction that is perpendicular to the current in the long wire and so there is no change in magnetic flux.

    {\small (This problem statement is missing information required to answer the question for case B. and C. If the velocity of an object is not changing, there is not a net force. Here we are not told whether or not an external force is being supplied to keep the velocity constant. In the answers for B. and C., it is assumed that there is not an external force being supplied to keep the velocity constant.)}

    B. and C. There is a net upwards magnetic force.

    D. no force -- there is no movement in a direction that is perpendicular to the current in the long wire and so there is no change in magnetic flux.

## Problem


\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[]{EMF and Induced Fields/figures/emf_and_Induced_Fields_Fig4.png}
\end{center}

1.  A conducting wire loop is placed in the magnetic field of a solenoid as shown. Determine whether there would be a current through the wire of the loop in each case below. If so, give the direction of the current. {\bf Explain your answer in terms of the magnetic forces exerted on the charges in the wire.}

    1.  The loop is stationary.

        {\bf Answer}: No moving charges so no force and thus no Lorentz force to start a current.

    2.  The loop is moving to the right.

    {\bf Answer}: 

    Let the $+\xhat$ direction be to the right and the $+\yhat$ direction be upwards. At the top of the ring, {\bf v} is in the $+\xhat$ direction, {\bf B} is in mostly in the $+\xhat$ direction and there is also a $-\yhat$ component, i.e., $B(a\hat{\bf x} + b\hat{\bf y}$).

    $$
    {\bf F} = qv\hat{\bf x} \times B(a\hat{\bf x} + b\hat{\bf y)} = qvbB(-\hat{\bf z})
    $$

    Thus the magnetic force is into the page at the top of the ring an so the current will be into the page at that location. This corresponds to a clockwise current if viewed from a point on the $+x$-axis.

    3.  The loop is moving to the left.

        {\bf Answer}: The same as above except that {\bf v} is in the $-\hat{\bf x}$ direction so:

        $$
        {\bf F} = qv(-\hat{\bf x}) \times B(a\hat{\bf x} + b\hat{\bf y}) = qvbB\hat{\bf z}
        $$

    Therefore the current will be counterclockwise if viewed from the $+x$-axis.

    1.  The direction of the induced magnetic field at the center of the loop due to the induced current.

        {\bf Answer}: Moving to the right: $-\hat{\bf x}$; Moving to the left: $+\hat{\bf x}$

    2.  Whether the loop is attracted to or repelled from the solenoid.

        {\bf Answer}: Moving to the right: repelled (field opposite solenoid's field); Moving to the left: attracted (field along solenoids field)

    3.  Whether the force required to move the loop increases or decreases as the loop is moved.

        {\bf Answer}: Moving to the right: increases, the magnetic field is increasing; Moving to the left: decreases, the magnetic field is decreasing

## Example

A spatially uniform external magnetic field points in the $\yhat$ direction and it is not changing with time. Assume that the normal direction of the cross-sectional area of loop is as shown in the diagram. \footnote{Recall that one can define to vectors that are perpendicular to a plane. Here we choose the normal as shown and as a result, positive rotation around the loop is determined by the right-hand rule using your thumb in the direction of the chosen normal direction.

The conducting loop of area $A$ is rotated in the direction shown.

1.  At what angles is the magnetic flux maximum, minimum, and zero?

2.  When $\phi=45^\circ$, is the magnetic flux positive or negative?

3.  When $\phi=135^\circ$, is the magnetic flux positive or negative?

4.  Based on your answers to (a)-(c), plot the magnetic flux as a function of $\phi$ as a smooth curve for $\phi=0$ to $\phi=180^\circ$.

{\bf Answer}:

\input{EMF and Induced Fields/figures/Square_Loop_III_Answer}

1.  At $\phi=0$, the flux will be a maximum, $\Phi_o=B_oA$. At $\phi=180^\circ$, the flux will be a minimum that is equal and magnitude and opposite in sign from the maximum. At $\phi=90^\circ$, the flux will be zero. 

2.  As shown in the diagram, the dot product of the normal vector and $\mathbf{B}_{ext}$ will be positive when $\phi=45^\circ$, so the flux will be positive.

3.  As shown in the diagram above, when $\phi=135^\circ$ the dot product of the normal vector and $\mathbf{B}_{ext}$ will be negative, so the flux will be negative.


4.  The curve is shown below. The curve is $\Phi=\Phi_o\cos\phi$.

## Problem

A spatially uniform external magnetic field points in the $\xhat$ direction and it is not changing with time.

The conducting loop is rotated in the direction shown at a constant rate.

Assume that the normal direction of the cross-sectional area of loop is as shown in the diagram.

\input{EMF and Induced Fields/figures/Square_Loop_IV}

1.  At what angles is the magnetic flux maximum, minimum, and zero? 

    {\bf Answer}:

    The magnetic flux will be zero when its surface is parallel to the external field (so that its normal/area vector is perpendicular to the external field). This corresponds to $\phi = 0^\circ$ and $\phi = 180^\circ$

    The maximum will be when all of the external magnetic field lines are parallel to the as the normal/area vector of the loop. This corresponds to $\phi = 270^\circ$.

    The minimum will be when all of the external magnetic field lines are anti-parallel to the as the normal/area vector of the loop. This corresponds to $\phi = 90^\circ$.

2.  When $\phi=45^\circ$, is the magnetic flux positive or negative? 

    {\bf Answer}: $\phi = 45^\circ$ is between one of the zeros and the minimum so it will be negative. 

3.  When $\phi=135^\circ$, is the magnetic flux positive or negative? 

    {\bf Answer}: $\phi = 135^\circ$ is between the minimum  and one of the zeros so it will be negative. 

4.  Based on your answers to (a)-(c), plot the magnetic flux as a function of $\phi$ as a smooth curve for $\phi=0$ to $\phi=180^\circ$.

    {\bf Answer}:

    \includegraphics[scale=0.3]{EMF and Induced Fields/figures/Inductance_fig2.3.d.png}

5.  At what angle or angles will the induced current be zero? (Hint: Lenz's law states that the induced current occurs when there is a changing flux and {it change} means with respect to time.)

    {\bf Answer}: The change in time occurs when the slope of this curve is zero so it occurs at $\phi = 90^\circ$ and $\phi = 270^\circ$

6.  At what angle or angles will the magnitude of induced current be maximum?

    {\bf Answer}: The maximum current occurs at $\phi = 0^\circ$ and $\phi = 180^\circ$

# LR Circuits (Ch 30)

## Introduction

\input{LR/figures/lr}

The above figure shows a LR series circuit consisting of an inductor of inductance $L$ connected in series with a resistor of resistance $R$. The switch, $S$, is closed at a time $t = 0$ and then remains closed. 

Using Kirchhoff’s voltage law around the loop, we have

$$
V_s - I(t) \cdot R - L \frac{dI(t)}{dt} = 0
$$

The term $L dI/dt$ is called the induced emf.

The above differential equation can be solved for $I(t)$, the current at any time given the initial value of $I$, which is zero. The result is

$$
I(t)=\frac{V_s}{R}\left(1-e^{-t/(L/R)}\right)
$$

After a long time, the current approaches a constant value of $I = V_s/R$ because the exponential term approaches zero and so there is effectively no time dependence in $I(t)$. How quickly the exponential term approaches zero depends on a quantity called the LR time constant defined by

$$\tau = L/R$$

which has units of seconds when $L$ is in Henrys and $R$ is in Ohms. With this, we can write

$$
I(t) = \frac{V_s}{R}\left(1-e^{-t/\tau}\right)
$$

In this equation, at $t=0$, the current is

$$
I(0) = (V_s/R)\left(1-e^{-0/\tau}\right)=(V_s/R)\left(1-1\right)=0
$$

As a result, we state that initially the inductor behaves like an open circuit because current does not flow though it.

For large $t/\tau$, the exponential term becomes much smaller than one and so the current becomes a constant value of $V_s/R$. If we replace the inductor with a wire, this is the same current that we would find. As a result, we state that after a long time, the inductor behaves like a resistanceless wire.

## Problem

\input{LR/figures/lr_plot}

In this problem, you will consider the equation

$$I(t) = \frac{V_s}{R}\left(1-e^{-t/\tau}\right)$$

that was described in the introduction.

* If $V_s/R=10\text{ A}$, plot dots for the values of $I$ at $t=0, 2, 4, 6, 12\text{ s}$ with $L/R = \tau = 2\text{ s}$ 
    
* Based on the equation, at $t=0$ does an inductor behave like an open circuit or a wire?
    
    {\bf Answer}: At $t=0$ the current will be $0$ with the inductor acting like a break in the circuit with no current flowing.

* Based on the equation, at $t\gg \tau$ does an inductor behave like an open circuit or a wire?

    \bf Answer}: At $t \gg \tau$ the current will be $V_s/R$ with the inductor acting like a wire -- the circuit behaves as it would if there were no inductor in it.
    
* If $L$ doubles but $R$ remains constant
    
    a. does the time constant $\tau$ increase, decrease, or remain the same?;
    
    b. how will the points that you drew for part 1. change? (Will they move up, down, or remain the same?) 

    c. Does your answer to b. make sense physically? That is, an inductor tends to impede changes in current and so is your answer to b. consistent with this? 

    {\bf Answer}: If $L$ increases, the inductor provides more resistance to change from its initial state, which is $I=0$. Thus we expect the current to take longer to reach its final state. All of the points (except for $t=0$ will move downward).

* The voltage across the inductor is $LdI/dt$. Compute $dI/dt$ and sketch its curve on the graph above. Is this equation consistent with the statement that for large $t/\tau$, the voltage across the inductor is zero?
    
    {\bf Answer:} $LdI/dt = -V_se^{-t/\tau}$. Yes. The voltage across the inductor is $-V_se^{-t/\tau}$ and for large $t/\tau$, $e^{-t/\tau}$ is near zero.

## Problem

An inductor with an inductance of $40\text{ mH}$ and a resistor with a resistance of 2\Omega$ are connected together to form a LR series circuit. If they are connected to a $20\text{ V}$ DC supply,

*   What will be the final steady state value of the current (the current after a very long time)?

    {\bf Answer}: At the steady state, the current passing through the inductor is constant, the induced emf becomes 0. Consequently, the voltage drop on the resistor is the same as the total voltage of the DC supply. 

    $$
    I = V_s/R=(20\text{ V})/(2\Omega) = 10\text{ A}
    $$

*   What is the time constant of the RL series circuit?

    {\bf Answer}: The time constant is given by $\tau = L/R = (40\text{ mH}w)/(2\Omega) = 20 \text{ ms}$

*   How long does it takes for the current to reach 63\% of its maximum value?

    {\bf Answer}: The current in the circuit is expressed as:

    $$
    I(t)=  \frac{V_s}{R}\left(1-e^{-t/(L/R)}\right)
    $$

    The maximum current value is $I_0=V_s/R$. Therefore, 

    $$
    \frac{I(t)}{I_0} = 1-e^{-t/(L/R)} = 1-e^{-t/\tau} 
    $$

    When $I(t)/I_0 =0.63$ and $\tau = L/R = 40\text{ ms}$:

    $$0.63 = 1-e^{-t/\tau}\Rightarrow\quad e^{-t/\tau} = 1-0.63 = 0.37$$

    $$-t/\tau = \ln(0.37) = -0.9943\quad\Rightarrow\quad t = 19.89\text{ ms}$$

    It takes roughly $20\text{ ms}$ ($\simeq \tau$) to reach $63\%$ of the maximum current value. (So $0.63$ is a special number for an LR circuit -- at $t=\tau$, the current is $0.63$ of its maximum value.)

* What will be the value of the induced emf after $10\text{ ms}$?

    {\bf Answer}: After 10 ms, the current is calculated as:

    $$
    I(t) = \frac{V_s}{R}(1-e^{-t/(L/R)}) = \frac{20 \text{ V}}{2~\Omega} \left(1-e^{-(10\text{ ms})/(20\text{ ms})}\right) = 3.9\text{ A} 
    $$

    The induced emf is:
    $$
    emf = V_s - IR= 20\text{ V} - 3.9\text{ A} \cdot 2~\Omega=12.2\text{ V} 
    $$

* What will be the value of the circuit current one time constant (that is, at $t=\tau$) after the switch is closed?

    {\bf Answer}: At time $t = \tau$,

    $$
    I(t) =  \frac{V_s}{R} (1-e^{-t/\tau})=10 \times (1-0.368) = 6.32\text{ A}
    $$

    This question is related to question 3. In the answer to question 3., it was found that it takes approximately one time constant to reach $63\%$ of the maximum value. So in this problem we expect that the answer to be approximately $63\%$ of the final value.

## Problem

\input{LR/figures/lr_discharge}

In the circuit above, an inductor with $L=10\text{ mH}$ and a resistor with $R=1\Omega$ is connected as shown. The battery has an emf of $10\text{ V}. At $t=0$, the switch $S_1$ is closed.


1.  What is the current through the resistor at $t=0$?

    {\bf Answer}: Zero. There is no closed path for current to flow.

2.  What is the current through the inductor at $t=0$?

    {\bf Answer}: Zero. There is no closed path for current to flow.

3.  After a long time, what will the current be through the resistor and inductor?

    {\bf Answer}: The current in the circuit as a function of time is

    $$
    I(t)=  \frac{V_s}{R}\left(1-e^{-t/(L/R)}\right)
    $$

    For large $t$, the exponential term is near zero, leaving $V_s/R=$10~V/1 $\Omega$ = $10$~A.

4.  After a long time, switch $S_1$ is opened and $S_2$ is closed simultaneously. Write Kirchhoff's voltage law around the new closed loop.

    {\bf Answer}: 
    $$
    - I(t) R - L\frac{dI(t)}{dt} = 0
    $$

5.  Show that the equation $I(t)=(10\text{ A})e^{-t/\tau}$ satisfies the equation in your answer to the previous question.

    {\bf Answer}: Starting with

    $$
    - I(t) \cdot R - L \frac{dI(t)}{dt} = 0
    $$

    And using $I=10e^{-t/\tau}$ and $d e^{t/\tau}/dt=(1/\tau) e^{-t/\tau}$, we have

    $$
    - (10\text{ A})e^{-t/\tau} \cdot (1\Omega) - (10\text{ mH}/\tau)e^{-t/\tau} = 0

    $$
    Using $\tau = L/R$ one arrives at

    $$
    - (10\text{ V})e^{-t/\tau} - (10\text{ V})e^{-t/\tau} = 0
    $$

6.  Plot $I(t)$ from $t=0$ to $t=0.01$~s. Assume that the switch $S_1$ was opened and switch $S_2$ was closed at $t=0.005$~s.

# Induction (Ch 29)

In this section we get our first look at the connection between magnetic and electric fields. A changing magnetic flux can \emph{induce} the flow of a current in a conducting loop. 

As a reminder, the general equation for magnetic flux is:

$$
\Phi_B = \int \mathbf{B}\cdot d\mathbf{A}
$$

If the magnitude (strength) of the magnetic field is not changing and the angle between the magnetic field vector and the area vector doesn't change over the surface, then integration is not required and we can write

$$\Phi_B = \mathbf{B}\cdot \mathbf{A}$$

or, equivalently,

$$\Phi_B = BA\cos\phi$$

See the previous tutorial for examples that demonstrate the use of this equation.

There are three ways in which flux can change:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The magnitude of $B$ can change. To do this, a magnet can be moved closer or farther away from a conducting loop, a loop can be moved closer or farther away from a magnet, or the current in the loop that is generating the magnetic field can be changed. See Example 29.1 in the book for an example of the creation of a changing magnetic field without a magnet.
    
    \item The area can change. To do this, the loop cross-section can be expanded or contracted, either by heating or cooling a wire or, more commonly, using a device called a slidewire generator (see Example 29.5).
    
    \item The angle can change. To do this, a conducting loop can be rotated (see Example 29.3). This is important in motors. 

\end{itemize}

In this tutorial, you will first determine the direction of the induced current using Lenz's law. After becoming familiar with the direction of the induced current, we will use Faraday's law to explore the induced emf that drives the induced current. Lenz's law follows from Faraday's Law. In principle, Faraday's law with careful attention paid to signs can be used to determine the direction of induced current, in which case Lenz's law is not needed. Like using the right-hand rules to get the direction for force is an alternative (and check) on the cross-product, Lenz's Law provides a check on the direction of the induced current. 

## Lenz's Law

As described in the textbook,

{\bf Lenz’s Law:} The direction of any magnetic induction effect is such as to oppose the cause of the effect.

Here, we'll use a simpler definition.

{\bf Lenz’s Law version 2.:} When the external magnetic flux through a conducting loop changes, a current appears (is induced) in the loop. This induced current creates an induced magnetic field. The direction of the induced current is such that the magnetic field it creates attempts to keep the magnetic flux unchanged.

{\bf{Answer}}:

(a) The magnetic field is in the opposite direction of as the normal, so $\Phi_B=\mathbf{B}_{ext}\cdot \mathbf{A}=\mathbf{B}_{ext}\cdot A\hat{\mathbf{n}}$ is negative. However, the external magnetic field is decreasing with time so the magnetic flux is increasing (the magnetic flux is large an negative initially; because $B_{ext}$ is decreasing with time, after a short amount of time the flux is still negative but closer to zero). Another way of working this out is to consider the derivative of flux: $\Phi_B=-B_{ext}A$, $d \Phi_B/dt = -AdB_{ext}/dt$. Here $dB_{ext}/dt$ is given to be negative, so $\Phi_B/dt$ is positive.

{\bf Answer}:

Here the magnetic field is in the opposite direction of the normal so $\mathbf{B}_{ext}\cdot A\hat{\mathbf{n}}$ is negative.

(b) The induced magnetic field would have to be into the page. The induced magnetic field would be in the direction opposite of the chosen normal direction for the loop.

(c) By the right-hand rule, a clockwise current creates a magnetic field into the page. This direction of induced current is such that its associated induced magnetic field is attempting to keep the magnetic flux unchanged.

(e) The sign of magnetic fluxes will change, the direction of the current will not change.


%To understand the direction a current will be induced in a wire, one can start by considering the magnetic forces on charges on a conductor that is moving within the field. 
%Note: we will discuss later that this is only part of the explanation and cannot explain the motion of charges when the conductor is not moving (but the field is still changing). 

## Induced Currents and the Lorentz Force Law

Lenz's law can only be used to determine the direction a current will flow in response to a changing magnetic flux through a conducting loop. It does not explain why currents start to flow. The currents flow due to one of two forces. These forces are 

\begin{itemize}
    \item The Lorentz force, which says that a charge moving in a magnetic field experiences a force according to $\mathbf{F}=q\mathbf{v}\times\mathbf{B}$. An example of this was given in Example 2.2 and 2.3. In both cases, the charges on the conductor are moving in a magnetic field and as a result, they will experience a Lorentz Force that initiates the flow of current.
    \item An induced electric field. In Example 2.1, the conductor is not moving and so its velocity is zero. But an induced current still appears. We must conclude that there is an induced electric field that causes the current to flow.

{\bf Answer}:
The Lorentz force will be zero on all sides (because $\mathbf{v}=0$) except for the moving wire. On the moving wire, $\mathbf{v}\times \mathbf{B}_{ext}$ is downwards (with a small component to the left because the velocity in the Lorentz force equation contains the velocity of the charge as it moves along the wire). The force on an electron will be in the opposite direction.

{\bf Answer}:
$${\bf F} = q{\bf v} \times {\bf B} $$
Both {\bf v} and {\bf B} are in the $\hat{\bf x}$ direction so 
$$v\hat{\bf x} \times B\hat{\bf x} = 0$$
So no force and thus no current.

{\bf Answer}:
$${\bf F} = q{\bf v} \times {\bf B} $$
{\bf v} is in the $\hat{\bf x}$ direction and {\bf B} is in the $\hat{\bf x}$ direction so 
$$v (-\hat{\bf x}) \times B\hat{\bf x} = vb(-\hat{\bf x} \times \hat{\bf x}) = 0$$
So no force and thus no current.

{\bf Answer}:

A. no force -- there is no movement in a direction that is perpendicular to the current in the long wire and so there is no change in magnetic flux.

{\small (This problem statement is missing information required to answer the question for case B. and C. If the velocity of an object is not changing, there is not a net force.

B. and C. There is a net upwards magnetic force.

D. no force -- there is no movement in a direction that is perpendicular to the current in the long wire and so there is no change in magnetic flux.

## Problem 4.4

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[]{EMF and Induced Fields/figures/emf_and_Induced_Fields_Fig4.png}
\end{center}

* A conducting wire loop is placed in the magnetic field of a solenoid as shown. Determine whether there would be a current through the wire of the loop in each case below. If so, give the direction of the current. {\bf Explain your answer in terms of the magnetic forces exerted on the charges in the wire.}

* The loop is stationary.

{\bf Answer}: No moving charges so no force and thus no Lorentz force to start a current.

* The loop is moving to the right.

{\bf Answer}: 

Let the $+\hat{\bf x}$ direction be to the right and the $+\hat{\bf y}$ direction be upwards. At the top of the ring, {\bf v} is in the $+\hat{\bf x}$ direction, {\bf B} is in mostly in the $+\hat{\bf x}$ direction and there is also a $-\hat{\bf y}$ component, i.e., $B(a\hat{\bf x} + b\hat{\bf y}$).

$$ {\bf F} = qv\hat{\bf x} \times B(a\hat{\bf x} + b\hat{\bf y)} = qvbB(-\hat{\bf z})$$

Thus the magnetic force is into the page at the top of the ring an so the current will be into the page at that location. This corresponds to a clockwise current if viewed from a point on the $+x$-axis.

* The loop is moving to the left.

{\bf Answer}:
The same as above except that {\bf v} is in the $-\hat{\bf x}$ direction so:

$$ {\bf F} = qv(-\hat{\bf x}) \times B(a\hat{\bf x} + b\hat{\bf y}) = qvbB\hat{\bf z}$$

Therefore the current will be counterclockwise if viewed from the $+x$-axis. 

* For each case in your answer to question 1. where there is an induced current find:

    * The direction of the induced magnetic field at the center of the loop due to the induced current.

    {\bf Answer}: Moving to the right: $-\hat{\bf x}$; Moving to the left: $+\hat{\bf x}$

    * Whether the loop is attracted to or repelled from the solenoid.

    {\bf Answer}: Moving to the right: repelled (field opposite solenoid's field); Moving to the left: attracted (field along solenoids field)

    * Whether the force required to move the loop increases or decreases as the loop is moved.

    {\bf Answer}: Moving to the right: increases, the magnetic field is increasing; Moving to the left: decreases, the magnetic field is decreasing

# LRC Circuits (Ch 31)

Previously, we have examined circuits that are powered by batteries which produce constant voltage (called a direct current, or DC). However, our power distribution system makes use of alternating current (AC) in which the voltages and currents vary sinusoidally with time. 

## R Only

The following figure shows a circuit in which an AC power source causes the current to vary  sinusoidally in time according to $i(t)=I\cos(\omega t)$. By Ohm's law, the equation for the instantaneous voltage across the resistor is $v_R(t) = IR\cos(\omega t)$.

\include{RLC and AC Circuits/figures/31_07_FigureA.jpg}
\include{RLC and AC Circuits/figures/31_07_FigureB.jpg}

We say that the voltage and current are "in phase" because the peaks, valleys, and zero crossings in the plots of $i(t)$ and $v_R(t)$ occur at the same time. 

## L Only

As before, the following figure shows a circuit in which an AC power source causes the current to vary sinusoidally in time according to $i(t)=I\cos(\omega t)$. 

In this case, the voltage across the inductor varies according to $v_L(t) = I\omega L\cos(\omega t + 90^o)$.

Because the term $\omega L$ occurs frequently, we give it a name of {\bf inductive reactance}: $X_L \equiv \omega L$. With this new variable, $v_L(t) = IX_L\cos(\omega t + 90^\circ)$.

We say the voltage across the inductor "leads" the current by $90^\circ$ (or, equivalently, $T/4$) because the maxima (or minima) in $v_R(t)$ occur before the maxima (or minima) in $i(t)$. In the following figure, the first minima of the plot of $v_R(t)$ is shown to occur earlier than the first minima in the $i(t)$ plot by $T/4$ (or equivalently, by $90^\circ$ or $\pi/2$).

\include{RLC and AC Circuits/figures/31_08_FigureA.jpg}

\include{RLC and AC Circuits/figures/31_08_FigureB.jpg}

## C Only

As before, the following figure shows a circuit in which an AC power source causes the current to vary sinusoidally in time according to $i(t)=I\cos(\omega t)$. 

In this case, the voltage across the capacitor varies according to $v_C(t) = (I/(\omega C))\cos(\omega t - 90^o)$.

Because the term $1/(\omega C)$ occurs frequently, we give it a name of {\bf capacitive reactance}: $X_C \equiv 1/(\omega C)$. With this new variable, $v_C(t) = IX_C\cos(\omega t - 90^\circ)$.

We say the voltage across the capacitor "lags" the current by $90^\circ$ (or, equivalently, $T/4$) because the maxima (or minima) in $v_C(t)$ occur after the maxima (or minima) in $i(t)$. In the following figure, the first minima of the $v_C(t)$ is shown to occur after than the first minima in the $i(t)$ plot by $T/4$.

## Series LRC circuit

Suppose that we know the current $i(t)$ in the following series LRC circuit is $i(t)=I\cos(\omega t)$.

\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{RLC and AC Circuits/figures/31_13_FigureA.jpg}

We want to know the voltage across the AC power supply, $v_{d}-v_{a}$, which we call $v$.

We know the voltage across each of the components from the discussion above.

$$
v_R(t) = IR\cos(\omega t)
$$

$$
v_L(t) = I\omega L\cos(\omega t + 90^\circ) = IX_L\cos(\omega t + 90^\circ)
$$

$$
v_C(t) = (I/(\omega C))\cos(\omega t - 90^\circ)=IX_C\cos(\omega t - 90^\circ)
$$

From Ohm's law, the voltages around a loop must be zero. From this, we have

$$
v(t)=v_R(t)+v_L(t)+v_C(t)
$$

Substitution gives

$$
v(t)=IR\cos(\omega t)+IX_L\cos(\omega t + 90^\circ)+IX_C\cos(\omega t - 90^\circ)
$$

In this activity, you will compute $v(t)$ in two ways. First, you will use the above formula and a trig identity to write $v(t)$ in the form $IZ\cos(\omega t+\phi)$, where the constants $Z$ and $\phi$ depend on $R$, $L$, and $C$ (or equivalently, $R$, $X_L$, and $X_C$). Next, you will use a general formula to compute $Z$ and $\phi$.

## Problem

Suppose you have a LRC circuit where $I$, $R$, $L$, and $C$ are given such that $IR=1\text{ [V]}$, $IX_L=1\text{ [V]}$, and $X_C=0$. In addition, we are given $i(t)=(1\text{ [A]})\cos\omega t$ and $\omega = 2\pi\text{ }[\text{s}^{-1}]$.

On the {\bf same} graph,

1.  Compute the period, $T$, of $i(t)$

    {\bf Answer}: There are two ways to answer this. (1) The current is $i(t)=\cos\omega t$. At $t=0$, $i=1$. When $\omega t=2\pi$, $i=1$ again for the first time. So the time for the $i(t)$ to be where it started is $t$ such that $\omega t=2\pi \Rightarrow t = 2\pi/(2\pi~[\text{s}^{-1}])=1~\text{ s}$. (2) Remember the formula $T=2\pi/\omega$.

2.  Plot $i(t)$

    {\bf Answer}: See https://www.desmos.com/calculator/klkajsstdc

3.  Plot $v_R(t)$

    {\bf Answer}: See Desmos plot

4.  Plot $v_L(t)$

    {\bf Answer}: See Desmos plot

5.  Plot $v_C(t)$

    {\bf Answer}: See Desmos plot. Note that $v_C = 0$ when $X_C=1/(\omega C)=0$. To get $X_C\approx 0$ in the Desmos plot, we set $C=1000$.

6.  Starting with $v(t)=v_R(t)+v_L(t)+v_C(t)$, use a trig identity to write $v(t)$ in the form\\ $v(t)=Z\cos(\omega t + \phi)$. That is, find the constants $Z$ and $\phi$. The trig identity is\\ $A\cos(\theta) + B\cos(\theta + \pi/2)=\sqrt{A^2+B^2}\cos\left(\theta + \tan^{-1}(B/A)\right)$

    {\bf Answer}: Here we have $v_R(t)=\cos\omega t$, $v_L(t)=\cos(\omega t+\pi/2)$, and $v_C(t)=0$, so $v(t)=\cos\omega t+\cos(\omega t+\pi/2)$. Comparing this with the identity, $A=B=1$ and we get $v(t)=\sqrt{2}\cos(\omega t + \tan^{-1}(1/1))=\sqrt{2}\cos(\omega t+\pi/4)$. Because of the $+\pi/4$, we say that $v(t)$ leads $i(t)$ by $\pi/4$ (or $45^\circ$ or $T/8$).

7.  Plot $v(t)$

    {\bf Answer}: See Desmos plot. Try to adjust the parameters $R$, $L$, and $C$ to see how they change the curves (both amplitudes and phases).

## Problem

In the previous problem, computing $v(t)$ required the use of a trig identity to combine $v_R$ and $v_L$ and write $v(t)$ in the form $v(t)=Z\cos(\omega t + \phi)$, where $Z$ and $\phi$ are constants that depend on $L$ and $R$. When $v_C$ is not zero, additional algebra is needed to compute $v(t)$ (by using the trig identity again). However, there is formula that can be used to find $v(t)$ in general so that trig identities are not needed to compute $v(t)$.

It can be shown that in general, the voltage across the AC power source is

$$
v(t) = IZ\cos(\omega t + \phi)
$$

Where the series LRC {\bf impedance} $Z$ is defined as

$$
Z = \sqrt{R^2 + (X_L-X_C)^2}
$$

and the {\bf phase angle} $\phi$ of $v(t)$ is defined as

$$
\phi = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{X_L - X_C}{R}\right) = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{\omega L - 1/(\omega C)}{R}\right)
$$

When $\phi$ is positive, $v(t)$ leads $i(t)$. When $\phi$ is negative, $v(t)$ lags $i(t)$. When $\phi=0$, $v(t)$ is in phase with $i(t)$.

1.  Using the parameters given in the previous problem, find $v(t)$ using the above formula.

    {\bf Answer}: In the previous problem, we were given $I=1$ and $\omega=2\pi$, $IR=1$, $IX_L=I\omega L=1$, $X_C=1/(\omega C)$. From this, we conclude $R=1$, $\omega L=1$, and $1/(\omega C)=0$. Thus

    $$
    Z = \sqrt{R^2 + (X_L-X_C)^2} = \sqrt{1^2 + (1 - 0)^2}
    $$

    and

    $$
    \phi = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{X_L - X_C}{R}\right) = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{1-0}{1}\right)=\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{1}\right) = \frac{\pi}{4}
    $$

    Thus,

    $$
    v(t) = IZ\cos(\omega t + \phi) = \sqrt{2}\cos(\omega t+\pi/4)
    $$

    which is the same as found in the previous problem.

2.  Does $v(t)$ lead or lag $i(t)$?

    {\bf Answer}: Lead. A plot of $i(t)$ and $v(t)$ shows that peaks in $v(t)$ occur {\it before} peaks in $i(t)$.
